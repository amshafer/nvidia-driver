<p>Many PCIe devices have limitations in what memory addresses they
can access for DMA purposes (based on the number of lines dedicated
to memory addressing). This can cause problems if the host system
has memory mapped to addresses beyond what the PCIe device can
support. If a PCIe device is allocated memory at an address beyond
what the device can support, the address may be truncated and the
device will access the incorrect memory location.</p>
<p>Note that since certain system resources, such as ACPI tables
and PCI I/O regions, are mapped to address ranges below the 4 GB
boundary, the RAM installed in x86/x86-64 systems cannot
necessarily be mapped contiguously. Similarly, system firmware is
free to map the available RAM at its or its users' discretion. As a
result, it is common for systems to have RAM mapped outside of the
address range [0, RAM_SIZE], where RAM_SIZE is the amount of RAM
installed in the system.</p>
<p>For example, it is common for a system with 512 GB of RAM
installed to have physical addresses up to ~513 GB. In this
scenario, a GPU with an addressing capability of 512 GB would force
the driver to fall back to the 4 GB DMA zone for this GPU.</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>There are multiple potential ways to solve a discrepancy between
your system configuration and a GPU's addressing capabilities.</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Select a GPU with addressing capabilities that match your target
configuration.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve optimal system and GPU performance is to
make sure that the capabilities of the two are in alignment. This
is especially important with multiple GPUs in the system, as the
GPUs may have different addressing capabilities. In this multiple
GPU scenario, other solutions could needlessly impact the GPU that
has larger addressing capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the system's IOMMU to the GPU's addressing
capabilities.</p>
<p>This is a solution targeted at developers and system builders.
The use of IOMMU may be an option, depending on system
configuration and IOMMU capabilities. Please contact NVIDIA to
discuss solutions for specific configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the amount of memory seen by the Operating System to match
your GPU's addressing capabilities with kernel configuration.</p>
<p>This is best used in the scenario where RAM is mapped to
addresses that slightly exceeds a GPU's capabilities and other
solutions are either not achievable or more intrusive. A good
example is the 512 GB RAM scenario outlined above with a GPU
capable of addressing 512 GB. The kernel parameter can be used to
ignore the RAM mapped above 512 GB.</p>
<p>This solution does affect the entire system and will limit how
much memory the OS and other devices can use. In scenarios where
there is a large discrepancy between the system configuration and
GPU capabilities, this is not a desirable solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove RAM from the system to align with the GPU's addressing
capabilities.</p>
<p>This is the most heavy-handed, but may ultimately be the most
reliable solution.</p>
</li>
