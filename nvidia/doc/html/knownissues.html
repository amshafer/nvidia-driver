engine</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Many games based on the Quake 3 engine set their textures to use
the <code class="computeroutput">GL_CLAMP</code> clamping mode when
they should be using <code class=
"computeroutput">GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE</code>. This was an oversight
made by the developers because some legacy NVIDIA GPUs treat the
two modes as equivalent. The result is seams at the edges of
textures in these games. To mitigate this, older versions of the
NVIDIA display driver remap <code class=
"computeroutput">GL_CLAMP</code> to <code class=
"computeroutput">GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE</code> internally to emulate the
behavior of the older GPUs, but this workaround has been disabled
by default. To re-enable it, uncheck the "Use Conformant Texture
Clamping" checkbox in nvidia-settings before starting any affected
applications.</p>

<dt><span class="term">FSAA</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>When FSAA is enabled (the __GL_FSAA_MODE environment variable is
set to a value that enables FSAA and a multisample visual is
chosen), the rendering may be corrupted when resizing the
window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">libGL DSO finalizer and pthreads</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>When a multithreaded OpenGL application exits, it is possible
for libGL's DSO finalizer (also known as the destructor, or
"_fini") to be called while other threads are executing OpenGL
code. The finalizer needs to free resources allocated by libGL.
This can cause problems for threads that are still using these
resources. Setting the environment variable "__GL_NO_DSO_FINALIZER"
to "1" will work around this problem by forcing libGL's finalizer
to leave its resources in place. These resources will still be
reclaimed by the operating system when the process exits. Note that
the finalizer is also executed as part of dlclose(3), so if you
have an application that dlopens(3) and dlcloses(3) libGL
repeatedly, "__GL_NO_DSO_FINALIZER" will cause libGL to leak
resources until the process exits. Using this option can improve
stability in some multithreaded applications, including Java3D
applications.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Thread cancellation</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Canceling a thread (see pthread_cancel(3)) while it is executing
in the OpenGL driver causes undefined behavior. For applications
that wish to use thread cancellation, it is recommended that
threads disable cancellation using pthread_setcancelstate(3) while
executing OpenGL or GLX commands.</p>

<p>This section describes problems that will not be fixed. Usually,
the source of the problem is beyond the control of NVIDIA.
Following is the list of problems:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<p class="title"><b>Problems that Will Not Be Fixed</b></p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">NV-CONTROL versions 1.8 and 1.9</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Version 1.8 of the NV-CONTROL X Extension introduced target
types for setting and querying attributes as well as receiving
event notification on targets. Targets are objects like X Screens,
GPUs and Quadro Sync devices. Previously, all attributes were
described relative to an X Screen. These new bits of information
(target type and target id) were packed in a non-compatible way in
the protocol stream such that addressing X Screen 1 or higher would
generate an X protocol error when mixing NV-CONTROL client and
server versions.</p>
<p>This packing problem has been fixed in the NV-CONTROL 1.10
protocol, making it possible for the older (1.7 and prior) clients
to communicate with NV-CONTROL 1.10 servers. Furthermore, the
NV-CONTROL 1.10 client library has been updated to accommodate the
target protocol packing bug when communicating with a 1.8 or 1.9
NV-CONTROL server. This means that the NV-CONTROL 1.10 client
library should be able to communicate with any version of the
NV-CONTROL server.</p>
<p>NVIDIA recommends that NV-CONTROL client applications relink
with version 1.10 or later of the NV-CONTROL client library
(libXNVCtrl.a, in the nvidia-settings-535.154.05.tar.bz2 tarball).
The version of the client library can be determined by checking the
NV_CONTROL_MAJOR and NV_CONTROL_MINOR definitions in the
accompanying nv_control.h.</p>
<p>The only web released NVIDIA FreeBSD driver that is affected by
this problem (i.e., the only driver to use either version 1.8 or
1.9 of the NV-CONTROL X extension) is 1.0-8756.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">CPU throttling reducing memory bandwidth on
IGP systems</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>For some models of CPU, the CPU throttling technology may affect
not only CPU core frequency, but also memory frequency/bandwidth.
On systems using integrated graphics, any reduction in memory
bandwidth will affect the GPU as well as the CPU. This can
negatively affect applications that use significant memory
bandwidth, such as video decoding using VDPAU, or certain OpenGL
operations. This may cause such applications to run with lower
performance than desired.</p>
<p>To work around this problem, NVIDIA recommends configuring your
CPU throttling implementation to avoid reducing memory bandwidth.
This may be as simple as setting a certain minimum frequency for
the CPU.</p>
<p>Depending on your operating system and/or distribution, this may
be as simple as writing to a configuration file in the /sys or
/proc filesystems, or other system configuration file. Please read,
or search the Internet for, documentation regarding CPU throttling
on your operating system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">VDPAU initialization failures on supported
GPUs</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>If VDPAU gives the VDP_STATUS_NO_IMPLEMENTATION error message on
a GPU which was labeled or specified as supporting PureVideo or
PureVideo HD, one possible reason is a hardware defect. After
ruling out any other software problems, NVIDIA recommends returning
the GPU to the manufacturer for a replacement.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a name="extension_string_size" id=
"extension_string_size"></a><span class="term">Some applications,
such as Quake 3, crash after querying the OpenGL extension
string</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some applications have bugs that are triggered when the
extension string is longer than a certain size. As more features
are added to the driver, the length of this string increases and
can trigger these sorts of bugs.</p>
<p>You can limit the extensions listed in the OpenGL extension
string to the ones that appeared in a particular version of the
driver by setting the <code class=
"computeroutput">__GL_ExtensionStringVersion</code> environment
variable to a particular version number. For example,</p>
<pre class="screen">
__GL_ExtensionStringVersion=17700 quake3
</pre>
<p>will run Quake 3 with the extension string that appeared in the
177.* driver series. Limiting the size of the extension string can
work around this sort of application bug.</p>

<dt><a name="gnome_shell_doesnt_update" id=
"gnome_shell_doesnt_update"></a><span class="term">gnome-shell
doesn't update until a window is moved</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Versions of libcogl prior to 1.10.x have a bug which causes
glBlitFramebuffer() calls used to update the window to be clipped
by a 0x0 scissor (see <a href=
"https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690451" target=
"_top">GNOME bug #690451</a> for more details). To work around this
bug, the scissor test can be disabled by setting the <code class=
"computeroutput">__GL_ConformantBlitFramebufferScissor</code>
environment variable to 0. Note this version of the NVIDIA driver
comes with an application profile which automatically disables this
test if libcogl is detected in the process.</p>

<dt><a name="Xserver_compares_only_the_matrix_part_of_a_transform"
id=
"Xserver_compares_only_the_matrix_part_of_a_transform"></a><span class="term">Some
X servers ignore the RandR transform filter during a modeset
request</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The RandR layer of the X server attempts to ignore redundant
RRSetCrtcConfig requests. If the only property changed by an
RRSetCrtcConfig request is the transform filter, some X servers
will ignore the request as redundant. This can be worked around by
also changing other properties, such as the mode, transformation
matrix, etc.</p>
