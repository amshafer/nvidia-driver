<p>A "display device" refers to a hardware device capable of
displaying an image. Most NVIDIA GPUs can drive multiple display
devices simultaneously.</p>
<p>Many X configuration options can be used to separately configure
each display device in use by the X screen. To address an
individual display device, you can use one of several names that
are assigned to it.</p>
<p>For example, the "ModeValidation" X configuration option by
default applies to all display devices on the X screen. E.g.,</p>
<pre class="screen">
    Option "ModeValidation" "NoMaxPClkCheck"
</pre>
<p>You can use a display device name qualifier to configure each
display device's ModeValidation separately. E.g.,</p>
<pre class="screen">
    Option "ModeValidation" "DFP-0: NoMaxPClkCheck; CRT-1: NoVesaModes"
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The description of each X configuration option in <a href=
"xconfigoptions.html" title=
"Appendix&nbsp;B.&nbsp;X Config Options">Appendix&nbsp;B, <i>X
Config Options</i></a> provides more detail on the available syntax
for each option.</p>
<p>The available display device names vary by GPU. To find all
available names for your configuration, start the X server with
verbose logging enabled (e.g., <strong class=
"userinput"><code>startx -- -logverbose 5</code></strong>, or
enable the "ModeDebug" X configuration option with <strong class=
"userinput"><code>nvidia-xconfig --mode-debug</code></strong> and
restart the X server).</p>
<p>The X log (normally /var/log/Xorg.0.log) will contain a list of
what display devices are valid for the GPU. E.g.,</p>
<pre class="screen">
(--) NVIDIA(0): Valid display device(s) on Quadro 6000 at PCI:10:0:0
(--) NVIDIA(0):     CRT-0
(--) NVIDIA(0):     CRT-1
(--) NVIDIA(0):     DELL U2410 (DFP-0) (connected)
(--) NVIDIA(0):     NEC LCD1980SXi (DFP-1) (connected)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The X log will also contain a list of which display devices are
assigned to the X screen. E.g.,</p>
<pre class="screen">
(II) NVIDIA(0): Display device(s) assigned to X screen 0:
(II) NVIDIA(0):   CRT-0
(II) NVIDIA(0):   CRT-1
(II) NVIDIA(0):   DELL U2410 (DFP-0)
(II) NVIDIA(0):   NEC LCD1980SXi (DFP-1)
</pre>
<p>Note that when multiple X screens are configured on the same
GPU, the NVIDIA X driver assigns different display devices to each
X screen. On X servers that support RandR 1.2 or later, the NVIDIA
X driver will create an RandR output for each display device
assigned to an X screen.</p>
<p>The X log will also report a list of "Name Aliases" for each
display device. E.g.,</p>
<pre class="screen">
(--) NVIDIA(0): Name Aliases for NEC LCD1980SXi (DFP-1):
(--) NVIDIA(0):   DFP
(--) NVIDIA(0):   DFP-1
(--) NVIDIA(0):   DPY-3
(--) NVIDIA(0):   DVI-I-3
(--) NVIDIA(0):   DPY-EDID-373091cb-5c07-6430-54d2-1112efd64b44
(--) NVIDIA(0):   Connector-0
</pre>
<p>These aliases can be used interchangeably to refer to the same
display device in any X configuration option, as an nvidia-settings
target specification, or in NV-CONTROL protocol that uses similar
strings, such as NV_CTRL_STRING_CURRENT_METAMODE_VERSION_2
(available through the nvidia-settings command line as
<strong class="userinput"><code>nvidia-settings --query
CurrentMetaMode</code></strong>).</p>
<p>Each alias has different properties that may affect which alias
is appropriate to use. The possible alias names are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>A "type"-based name (e.g., "DFP-1"). This name is a unique index
plus a display device type name, though in actuality the "type
name" is selected based on the protocol through which the X driver
communicates to the display device. If the X driver communicates
using VGA, then the name is "CRT"; if the driver communicates using
TMDS, LVDS, or DP, then the name is "DFP".</p>
<p>This may cause confusion in some cases (e.g., a digital flat
panel connected via VGA will have the name "CRT"), but this name
alias is provided for backwards compatibility with earlier NVIDIA
driver releases.</p>
<p>Also for backwards compatibility, an alias is provided that uses
the "type name" without an index. This name alias will match any
display device of that type: it is not unique across the X
screen.</p>
<p>Note that the index in this type-based name is based on which
physical connector is used. If you reconnect a display device to a
different connector on the GPU, the type-based name will be
different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A connector-based name (e.g., "DVI-I-3"). This name is a unique
index plus a name that is based on the physical connector through
which the display device is connected to the GPU. E.g., "VGA-1",
"DVI-I-0", "DVI-D-3", "LVDS-1", "DP-2", "HDMI-3", "eDP-6",
"USB-C-0". On X servers that support RandR 1.2 or later, this name
is also used as the RandR output name.</p>
<p>Note that the index in this connector-based name is based on
which physical connector is used. If you reconnect a display device
to a different connector on the GPU, the connector-based name will
be different.</p>
<p>When Mosaic is enabled, this name is prefixed with a GPU
identifier to make it unique. For example, a Mosaic configuration
with two DisplayPort devices might have two different outputs with
names "GPU-0.DP-0" and "GPU-1.DP-0", respectively. See <a href=
"gpunames.html" title=
"Appendix&nbsp;I.&nbsp;GPU Names">Appendix&nbsp;I, <i>GPU
Names</i></a> for a description of valid GPU names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An EDID-based name (e.g.,
"DPY-EDID-373091cb-5c07-6430-54d2-1112efd64b44"). This name is a
SHA-1 hash, formatted in canonical UUID 8-4-4-4-12 format, of the
display device's EDID. This name will be the same regardless of
which physical connector on the GPU you use, but it will not be
unique if you have multiple display devices with the same EDID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An NV-CONTROL target ID-based name (e.g., "DPY-3"). The NVIDIA X
driver will assign a unique ID to each display device on the entire
X server. These IDs are not guaranteed to be persistent from one
run of the X server to the next, so is likely not convenient for X
configuration file use. It is more frequently used in communication
with NV-CONTROL clients such as nvidia-settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A connector number-based name (e.g., "Connector-0"), where each
name identifies a physical connector on the graphics card.
Connector numbers for these names are guaranteed to begin at 0 and
monotonically increase to the maximum number of connectors on the
graphics card.</p>
<p>Note that multiple display devices may have the same connector
number-based name: DisplayPort Multi-Stream devices on the same
connector, or display devices representing different protocols that
can be possibly driven by the same connector (e.g., DisplayPort
versus TMDS protocols driven over a DisplayPort connector).</p>
<p>This name is most useful with the "ConnectedMonitor" X
configuration option in situations where you want to emulate the
presence of one or more connected monitors, but do not necessarily
care which physical connectors are used. E.g.,</p>
<pre class="screen">
    Option "ConnectedMonitor" "Connector-0, Connector-1"
</pre>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When DisplayPort 1.2 branch devices are present, display devices
will be created with type- and connector-based names that are based
on how they are connected to the branch device tree. For example,
if a connector named DP-2 has a branch device attached and a
DisplayPort device is connected to the branch device's first
downstream port, a display device named <code class=
"computeroutput">DP-2.1</code> might be created. If another branch
device is connected between the first branch device and the display
device, the name might be <code class=
"computeroutput">DP-2.1.1</code>.</p>
<p>Any display device name can have an optional GPU qualifier
prefix. E.g., "GPU-0.DVI-I-3". This is useful in Mosaic
configurations: type- and connector-based display device names are
only unique within a GPU, so the GPU qualifier is used to
distinguish between identically named display devices on different
GPUs. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    Option "MetaModes"   "GPU-0.CRT-0: 1600x1200, GPU-1.CRT-0: 1024x768"
</pre>
<p>If no GPU is specified for a particular display device name, the
setting will apply to any devices with that name across all GPUs.
Note that the GPU UUID can also be used as the qualifier. E.g.,
"GPU-758a4cf7-0761-62c7-9bf7-c7d950b817c6.DVI-I-1". See <a href=
