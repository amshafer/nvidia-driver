      a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.

    * Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings
      from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2

    * Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in
      geometry and tessellation control shaders.

======== Release 515 Entries ========

2022-11-22 version 515.86.01

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to find incorrect fan speed
      ranges on some GPUs.  Lower-level layers of the driver protected
      the hardware from programming incorrect fan speeds, so the symptom
      was only incorrect reporting.  Now, reporting in nvidia-settings
      matches what actually gets programmed in hardware.

      request timed out.

    * Fixed an issue where NvFBC direct capture would wait for multiple queued
      frames to finish rendering, instead of returning the next rendered frame.

    * Added support for NvFBC direct capture to composite the mouse cursor onto
      frames.

    * Fixed an issue where Vulkan direct to display could not drive more than
      4 displays from a single VkInstance.

2022-05-31 version 515.48.07

    * Improved Vulkan swapchain creation failure reporting. Applications can use the
      VK_EXT_debug_utils extension to receive additional information when an error was
      encountered in vkCreateSwapchainKHR().

2022-05-11 version 515.43.04

    * Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.

    * NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog
      automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually
      saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance
      of the quit dialog was thus also removed.

    * Added support for the VK_KHR_shader_subgroup_uniform_control_flow
      extension.

    * Fixed a bug where VK_NVX_binary_import was advertised as supported on
      unsupported platforms. This caused calls to vkCreateDevice to fail if
      applications attempted to enable VK_NVX_binary_import on such platforms.

2021-10-14 version 495.29.05

    * Add indicator for Resizable BAR support on compatible systems.

      certain desktops such as GNOME.

2021-11-10 version 470.86

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * RTX A2000 12GB

      with other types of attribute assignments.

    * Added a workaround for DOOM Eternal, which avoids an application bug where
      Vulkan swapchain recreation events are not properly handled. On desktops
      like GNOME where the window is initially redirected to the compositor,
      this may prevent the game from flipping (and thus enabling G-SYNC).

    * Added a workaround for Far Cry 5 when run through DXVK, which avoids a
      shader race condition bug that was previously exposed by new compiler
      optimizations.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * A100-PG506-207
        * A100-PG506-217

    * Increased the maximum limit on concurrent OpenGL contexts. This
      limit was previously constrained by a fixed-size internal driver
      resource, and is now constrained by available system memory.

    * Applications that exceed the maximum limit on concurrent OpenGL
      contexts will now receive a BadAlloc X error rather than crashing.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash upon shutdown
      with some configurations using GPU screens.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause rendering errors when displaying scaled
      MetaModes using the "Nearest" resampling method.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause NvFBC's "direct capture" to crash the X
      server when certain GLX calls are made during a capture.

    * Added support for VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_REALTIME_EXT from the
      VK_EXT_global_priority extension. This enables support for asynchronous
      reprojection in SteamVR.

      VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_REALTIME_EXT is supported on Pascal GPUs and
      newer.

      Global priorities other than VK_QUEUE_GLOBAL_PRIORITY_MEDIUM_EXT require
      root privileges or the CAP_SYS_NICE capability.

    * Added support for the VK_EXT_global_priority_query extension.

    * Added support for the VK_EXT_provoking_vertex extension.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause intermittent corruption in Wolfenstein:
      Youngblood when using NVIDIA Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs.

    * Added support for the VK_EXT_color_write_enable extension.

    * Added support for the VK_EXT_vertex_input_dynamic_state extension.

    * Added support for the VK_EXT_ycbcr_2plane_444_formats extension.

    * Added support for the VK_NV_inherited_viewport_scissor extension.

    * NvFBC's "direct capture" mode no longer causes flipping to be
      disabled for applications being captured. G-SYNC can now also be
      used simultaneously with NvFBC direct capture.

    * Enabled the NVIDIA driver, by default, to attempt to initialize SLI when
      using GPUs with different amounts of video memory.  Previously, this was
      only available when bit 1 was set in the "Coolbits" X config option.

    * Updated GPU fan control to be available by default in
      nvidia-settings and NV-CONTROL, for GPU boards that support
      programmable fan control.  Previously, this was only available
      when bit 2 was set in the "Coolbits" X config option.

    * Fixed an issue where vkCreate{Graphics,Compute}Pipeline would sometimes
      crash when the shaders contained resources with no set/binding.

    * Fixed a memory fault in the Vulkan driver when using some smaller
      dimensions of sparse images.

    * Fixed an issue with vkCmdSetViewport when firstViewport is non-zero.

    * Fixed handling of VK_DESCRIPTOR_BINDING_VARIABLE_DESCRIPTOR_COUNT_BIT for
      variable size descriptor bindings.

    * Changed the compression used for the FreeBSD package from gzip to xz.

    * Increased the default size for new OpenGL/Vulkan Shader Disk Cache
      location to 1024MB. Note that caches with paths containing "/.nv/ will
      continue to use the previous default of 128MB unless the size is manually
      overridden. For more information see the "OpenGL Shader Disk Cache"
      section in the "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" chapter
      of the README.

    * Changed the default location for new OpenGL/Vulkan Shader Disk Caches.
      If the location is not manually overridden and a cache is detected in the
      previous default location, that location will be used instead of the new
      default location. For more information see the "OpenGL Shader Disk Cache"
      section in the "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" chapter
      of the README.

    * Removed support for the following deprecated frame lock NV-CONTROL
      attributes:

        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE

    * Default AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration to True such that the NVIDIA X
      driver succeeds when launching the X server even if there are no display
      devices connected.

    * RRGetCrtcInfo will now return Rotate_0 instead of 0 as the active
      rotation for disabled CRTCs.

    * Improved the NVIDIA VDPAU implementation of
      VdpVideoSurfaceGetBitsYCbCr and VdpVideoSurfacePutBitsYCbCr when
      using planar or semi-planar formats.  This helps applications that
      transfer data between VDPAU video surfaces and system memory.

    * Added support for Vulkan direct-to-display on DisplayPort displays which
      are connected via DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (DP-MST).

    * Added a new documentation file, supported-gpus.json, which exposes a
      machine-readable list of supported GPUs and features.

    * Added an implementation of glNamedBufferPageCommitmentARB, which was
      missing from the NVIDIA driver's support for the GL_ARB_sparse_buffer
      extension.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a KDE Plasma session to crash when running
      under Wayland.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some Swap Group configurations to present
      at half of the display refresh rate.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented X11 EGL displays from being reinitialized.

    * The 450 driver series is the last that supports NvFBC's
      NVFBC_CAPTURE_TO_HW_ENCODER capture interface, which has been deprecated
      since NVIDIA Capture SDK 6.0 released in 2017. Future NVIDIA drivers
      after the 450 series will return NVFBC_ERR_UNSUPPORTED if that capture
      interface is requested.
      The recommended way to encode captured frames with NVENC is by using the
      NVIDIA Video Codec SDK.
      See: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk

    * Fixed a bug causing the Plasma desktop panel to freeze when
      compositing is disabled (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=353983)

      in the README for more information.

    * Added HEVC 10/12 bit "decode only" support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver. 
      Note that VDPAU's presentation pipeline and OpenGL-VDPAU interop
      does not support 10- and 12-bit video surfaces yet. See the "VDPAU Support"
      appendix in the README for supported HEVC decoder profiles.

    * Added support for Image Sharpening for OpenGL and Vulkan applications

    * Added new VdpYCbCrFormats VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_Y_U_V_444_16,
      VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_P010 and VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_P016 for accessing 16-bit
      surfaces via VdpVideoSurfaceGetBitsYCbCr() and VdpVideoSurfacePutBitsYCbCr()
      in the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.

    * Added support to create 16-bit video surfaces in the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.

    * Added a prebuilt GTK+3 backend nvidia-settings-gtk3.so to the FreeBSD
      install package.

    * Enabled GPU screens by default on X.Org xserver version 1.20.7 and higher.

    * Fixed a bug where rendering in a separate user namespace (unshare -U)
      would show black window and produce Xid 13 errors.

======== Release 445 Entries ========

    * Removed support for "IgnoreDisplayDevices" X configuration option.

======== Release 440 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when using large

        * GeForce GTX 1650 Ti
        * GeForce GTX 1650 Ti with Max-Q Design
        * GeForce RTX 2060 with Max-Q Design
        * Quadro T1000 with Max-Q Design

    * Added new "Connector-N" display device aliases to the X driver's
      X configuration option parser.  This is useful in conjunction with
      the "ConnectedMonitor" X configuration option, for emulating the
      presence of connected monitors without knowing what specific
      connectors are available.  See the "Display Device Names" appendix
      in the README for details.

2020-04-07 version 440.82

    * Allow presenting from queue families which only expose
      VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT when using XCB in addition to Xlib surfaces.

2020-02-28 version 440.64

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce MX330
        * GeForce MX350

    * Fixed a regression that allowed displays to enter DPMS mode even
      when DPMS is disabled in the X server settings.

2020-02-03 version 440.59

    * Disabled frame rate limiting for configurations without active
      displays when HardDPMS is enabled.

    * Restricted the maximum number of GPU Screens to one GPU Screen per
      GPU device, to prevent X from crashing when more than one GPU Screen
      is configured for a single GPU device.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash while exiting
      DPMS with HardDPMS enabled.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Tesla PG500-216
        * Tesla PG503-216

      in nvidia-settings if an existing configuration file is not detected.

2019-12-11 version 440.44

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications running directly on a display
      (such as VR HMDs) to tear when a G-SYNC or G-SYNC Compatible monitor
      is plugged in the system.

2019-11-22 version 440.36

    * Fixed graphical corruption that can occur when using
      glslang SPIR-V Generator Version <= 2.

    * Added FreeBSD/i386 32-bit compatibility libraries to the FreeBSD/amd64
      package.

2019-11-04 version 440.31

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Tesla V100S-PCIE-32GB
        * GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER

2019-10-17 version 440.26

    * Updated the confirmation dialog box that is displayed when quitting
      the nvidia-settings control panel to report when there are pending
      configuration changes which will be lost if they are not applied or
      saved before quitting.

    * Enabled parallel GLSL shader linking by default; i.e., allow
      GL_ARB_parallel_shader_compile to work without first calling
      glMaxShaderCompilerThreadsARB().

    * Added support for HDMI 2.1 variable refresh rate (VRR) G-SYNC Compatible
      monitors on supported GPUs.  For more details, see "Configuring Multiple
      Display Devices on One X Screen" in the README.

    * Added support for the GLX_NV_multigpu_context and GL_NV_gpu_multicast
      extensions.  For more details, see the "Configuring SLI and Multi-GPU
      FrameRendering" chapter of the README, and the extension specifications:

        https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/GLX_NV_multigpu_context.txt
        https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_gpu_multicast.txt

    * Enabled HardDPMS by default. See the README entry on the X configuration
      option "HardDPMS" for more information.

    * Added VP9 decode support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver. See the
      VDPAU Support appendix in the README for supported VP9 decoder
      profiles.

    * Changed GPU clock management strategy to more quickly ramp down clocks
      after a drop in GPU utilization.

    * Added X configuration option, "SidebandSocketPath", which
      controls the directory in which the X driver will create a
      pathname UNIX domain socket used to communicate with the NVIDIA
      OpenGL, Vulkan and VDPAU driver components.

======== Release 435 Entries ========

2019-08-29 version 435.21

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when using HardDPMS with
      an NVIDIA-driven GPU Screen.

2019-08-13 version 435.17

    * Fixed a bug which caused the kernel to panic when exiting a single X
      server when multiple X servers were active and in an SLI configuration.

    * Added support for changing Digital Vibrance in the display controls
      section of nvidia-settings on Turing hardware.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the NVIDIA X driver to behave incorrectly or
      crash when a client queried Xinerama information on X servers with a
      non-NVIDIA X screen as screen 0.

    * Fixed the "Image Settings" options in the "OpenGL Settings" page of
      nvidia-settings for Quadro GPUs.  Previously, OpenGL rendering on Quadro
      would behave as if the "High Quality" option were selected regardless of
      the selection.  Now, the setting will default to "High Quality" for
      Quadro but selecting a lower option will affect rendering accordingly.
      (Other GPUs are unchanged: the default remains "Quality", but other
      options can be selected if desired.)

======== Release 430 Entries ========

2019-11-05 version 430.64

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when running
      applications using GLX indirect rendering.

    * Fall back to system memory when video memory is full for some
      driver-internal allocations. This can help fix Xid 13 and 
      Xid 31 cases in Vulkan applications when video memory is full.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a blank screen on some DisplayPort
      monitors when logging in to GNOME, if the nvidia-drm kernel module
      parameter modeset=1 is specified.

2019-09-11 version 430.50

2019-07-29 version 430.40

    * Fixed a bug that caused the FreeBSD installer package to install
      empty Linux compatibility library files.

2019-04-23 version 430.09

    * Added HEVC YUV 4:4:4 decode support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.

    * Added the new per-decoder profile capability bit
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_SUPPORTED_CHROMA_TYPES to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.

    * Added new VdpYCbCrFormats VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_Y_UV_444 and
      VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_Y_U_V_444 for accessing YUV 4:4:4 surfaces via 
      VdpVideoSurfaceGetBitsYCbCr() and VdpVideoSurfacePutBitsYCbCr()
      in the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.

    * Added support for creation of YUV 4:4:4 video surfaces in 
      the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.

    * Fixed display color range handling on pre-Turing GPUs, such that when
      limited color range is selected through the display controls page in
      nvidia-settings, output pixel values will be correctly clamped to
      Consumer Technology Association (CTA) range.

    * Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.7 (video driver
      ABI version 6).

======== Release 418 Entries ========

        * Quadro T1000
        * Quadro T2000

    * Fixed a bug, introduced in 415.13, that caused audio over DisplayPort to
      not work in some configurations.

2019-05-07 version 418.74

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro P2200
        * GeForce GTX 1650
        * GeForce GTX 1650 with Max-Q Design
        * GeForce GTX 1660 Ti with Max-Q Design

2019-03-20 version 418.56

    * Updated nvidia-settings to disable line wrapping when outputting to a
      non-terminal in command-line mode. From GitHub pull request:

          https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-settings/pull/37

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to more accurately reflect the
      current availability of G-SYNC or G-SYNC compatible display settings.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 1660
        * GeForce MX230
        * GeForce MX250

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GTX 1660 Ti

2019-01-30 version 418.30

    * Added initial support for G-SYNC Compatible monitors.  See the README
      for details.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design
        * GeForce RTX 2080 with Max-Q Design

    * Updated the NVIDIA VDPAU driver to support allocating VDPAU video
      surfaces with explicit field or frame picture structure.

    * Added support for the GL_NV_vdpau_interop2 OpenGL extension,
      which allows VDPAU/OpenGL surface sharing with explicit field or
      frame picture structure. Picture structure selection by applications
      can avoid the need for implicit surface structure conversion by
      the OpenGL implementation.

    * Updated the VDPAU driver to reject decoding to YUV 4:2:2 video
      surfaces.  The NVIDIA VDPAU driver always produces YUV 4:2:0
      content.  Previously, the VDPAU driver implicitly converted a YUV
      4:2:2 video surface to YUV 4:2:0 during decode.  Now, the VDPAU
      driver will fail the decode request.

======== Release 415 Entries ========

2019-01-15 version 415.27

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce RTX 2060

    * Fixed a bug that caused corruption on vkCmdCopyImage calls for non-2D
      texture targets.

2018-11-08 version 415.13

    * Improved error reporting in eglSwapBuffers() by generating codes for
      some missing error types, and adding additional detail to the already
      existing ones.

    * Improved the appearance and functionality of the nvidia-settings
      control panel when it is resized to small sizes.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent some icons from
      being displayed incorrectly while using some GTK+ themes.

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused the "NoEdidModes" token of the
      "ModeValidation" X configuration option to reject non-EDID modes
      whose timings matched EDID modes.

    * Fixed an OpenGL driver bug that caused the upper bounds of
      floating-point viewports, specified through the ARB_viewport_array
      extension, to be clipped incorrectly.

    * Added a new X configuration option "HardDPMS" which
      is disabled by default, but can be enabled to put displays to sleep with
      modesets rather than VESA DPMS. This may fix some displays that fail to
      sleep when DPMS becomes active. "HardDPMS" will be enabled by default in a
      future release.

    * Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.5 (video driver
      ABI version 4).

    * Added a Wayland platform library, libnvidia-egl-wayland.so, to allow
      Wayland compositors that support EGLDevice, EGLOutput, and EGLStreams
      to share EGL buffers with Wayland applications.

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug where conditional rendering (NV_conditional_render)
      was incorrectly affecting mipmap generation.

======== Release 410 Entries ========

    * Updated nvidia-settings to allow continued interaction with other
      pages and help content while editing application profiles.

        * Quadro RTX 4000
        * Tesla T4

2018-10-25 version 410.73

2018-10-16 version 410.66

    * Added a USB-C display connector type identifier, such that a display
      connected using Turing's USB-C connector will be named, e.g., "USB-C-0"
      rather than "DP-5". Scripts and configuration files that use the DP
      identifier for this connector will be affected.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro RTX 5000
        * Quadro RTX 6000
        * GeForce RTX 2070

2018-09-19 version 410.57

    * The GLX and EGL libraries now use the OpenGL Vendor-Neutral Dispatch
      (libglvnd) interface.

      The driver package includes a prebuilt copy of the libglvnd libraries,
      which it will install by default if pkg-config doesn't report an existing
      copy of libglvnd.

    * Added a graphics API visual indicator.  It can be toggled through
      nvidia-settings' "OpenGL Settings" panel, the
      __GL_SHOW_GRAPHICS_OSD environment variable, or the
      GLShowGraphicsOSD application profile.  See the README for more
      information.

    * Exposed EGL 1.5 in the EGL version string. This does not add
      any extra functionality to the EGL driver. All EGL 1.5 features
      were already supported through EGL 1.4 plus extensions.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
        * GeForce RTX 2080
        * Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB-LS
        * Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB-LS
        * Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB-LS
        * Tesla V100-SXM3-32GB

    * Updated the minimum required version of FreeBSD to 10.4-RELEASE.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU-decoded H.265/HEVC content to have
      interlaced artifacts when shared with OpenGL through the
      GL_NV_vdpau_interop extension.

======== Release 396 Entries ========

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * Quadro P5200 with Max-Q Design

      when exiting.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * TITAN V JHH Special Edition

2018-05-02 version 396.24

    * Fixed a regression that caused the current MetaMode's ViewPortIn and
      ViewPortOut settings to be preserved across RandR modesets. The driver now
      clears ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut when the mode is set through RandR,
      restoring the behavior that existed prior to the regression.

2018-04-10 version 396.18

    * Updated the SLI Mosaic configuration page in nvidia-settings to make
      more layout configurations available, including configurations that
      do not utilize all of the available displays.

    * Added reporting of EGL information to nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the NV_CTRL_STEREO_SWAP_MODE setting for
      quad-buffered stereo visuals to not be preserved across modesets
      or VT switches.

    * Added a new global X configuration option "AllowExternalGpus", which
      defaults to disabled, but can be enabled to allow eGPUs and other
      surprise-removable GPUs to be configured with X screens.

======== Release 390 Entries ========

2022-11-22 version 390.157

2022-08-02 version 390.154

2022-05-16 version 390.151

2020-06-24 version 390.138

2019-11-08 version 390.132

2019-07-29 version 390.129

    * Added support for FreeBSD 12.0-RC3.

    * Fixed a bug that caused mode switches to fail when an SDI output board was
      connected.

    * Added the synchronization state for PRIME Displays to nvidia-settings.

2018-08-27 version 390.87

    * Fixed a resource leak introduced in the 390 series of drivers that could
      lead to reduced performance after starting and stopping several OpenGL
      and/or Vulkan applications.

2018-07-16 version 390.77

    * Removed informational messages that were printed by nvidia-modeset.ko
      whenever a GPU device was allocated or freed.

    * Fixed a bug that caused kwin OpenGL compositing to crash when
      launching certain OpenGL applications.

2018-06-05 version 390.67

    * Fixed a bug that could cause kernel panics when using Quadro SDI
      Capture hardware.

    * Fixed an intermittent crash when launching applications through Wine.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the driver, in some low bandwidth DisplayPort
      configurations, to not implicitly enable display dithering.  This
      resulted in visible banding.

2018-05-16 version 390.59

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 1050 with Max-Q Design
        * Tesla V100-FHHL-16GB
        * Quadro P3200

        * Quadro GV100
        * Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB
        * Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB
        * Tesla V100-DGXS-32GB

    * Updated the driver to prevent G-SYNC from being enabled when a
      Quadro Sync board is installed. G-SYNC and Quadro Sync were always
      mutually incompatible features, and this change makes it easier to
      use G-SYNC capable monitors on Quadro Sync configurations, as it is
      now no longer necessary to manually disable G-SYNC.

    * Further improved the fix for occasional flicker when using the X
      driver's composition pipeline.  This was mostly fixed in 390.42,
      but now the fix should be more complete.

2018-03-12 version 390.42

    * Fixed a regression, introduced in 390.12, that caused occasional
      flicker when using the X driver's composition pipeline, for
      example when using screen transformations like rotation, or the
      "ForceCompositionPipeline" or "ForceFullCompositionPipeline"
      options."

    * Fixed a regression introduced in 390.12 that prevented displays from
      working normally when running multiple X screens with emulated overlays.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 1060 5GB
        * Quadro P620

2018-01-04 version 390.12

    * Added new application profile settings, "EGLVisibleDGPUDevices" and
      "EGLVisibleTegraDevices", to control which discrete and Tegra GPU
      devices, respectively, may be enumerated by EGL. See the "Application
      Profiles" appendix of the driver README for more details.

    * Updated the SLI Mosaic layout page in the nvidia-settings control
      panel to support topologies with up to 32 displays.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented Xinerama Info from being handled properly
      in SLI or Base Mosaic layouts with more than 24 displays.

    * Updated the X driver's composition pipeline (used for rotation,
      warp and blend, transformation matrices, etc) to also support stereo.

    * Added an OpenGL stereo preview feature to the screen page in
      nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a bug where GetTexSubImage() would read incorrect data into
      a pixel buffer object when supplied with a target of
      GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY and a non-zero yoffset value.

    * Added support for generic active stereo with in-band DisplayPort
      signaling. The X configuration option "InbandStereoSignaling" is
      deprecated in favor of this stereo mode. See "Appendix B. X Config
      Options" in the README for more information.

    * Modified the driver to avoid restoring framebuffer console modes
      on virtual reality head-mounted displays.

======== Release 387 Entries ========

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * TITAN Xp COLLECTORS EDITION
        * GeForce GTX 1070 Ti
        * TITAN V

2017-10-30 version 387.22

    * Fixed a regression that could cause driver errors when setting modes
      that include DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport devices.

2017-10-03 version 387.12

    * Fixed a regression that caused some display connectors on some GPUs to not
      report a connected HDMI or DisplayPort audio device even if the connected
      monitor supports audio.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the "Reset Default Configuration"
      button in the nvidia-settings "ECC Settings" page from being available
      when the ECC configuration is set to a non-default state.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to enforce overly aggressive
      limits on display positions in the "X Server Display Configuration"
      page under some circumstances.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the "Enable Base Mosaic (Surround)"
      checkbox in nvidia-settings to disappear when an X screen, rather than
      a display, is selected in the "X Server Display Configuration" page.

    * Fixed a race condition that could lead to crashes when OpenGL programs
      manipulated vertex buffer objects from multiple threads simultaneously.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to retain
      some settings that had been applied, but not confirmed. This resulted
      in unwanted settings being applied to subsequent settings changes.

    * Added support for YUV 4:2:0 compression for monitors connected via
      DisplayPort in configurations where either the display or GPU is
      incapable of driving the current mode in RGB 4:4:4.  See the
      description in the "Programming Modes" appendix for details.

    * Added framebuffer console hot plug handling to nvidia-modeset.

      Note that hot plugging is only handled when nvidia-modeset is initialized;
      for example, when Xorg or nvidia-persistenced is running.

    * Added an "AllowGSYNC" MetaMode attribute that can be used to disable
      G-SYNC completely. This can be use to allow enabling features that are
      incompatible with G-SYNC, such as Ultra Low Motion Blur or Frame Lock.

    * Tiled monitors formerly resulted in a separate Xinerama screen being
      reported for each tile. They will now, by default, be combined into a
      single large Xinerama screen.

    * The individual panels in a tiled monitor will now be arranged based
      on the layout information provided in the monitor's EDID. This can be
      overridden by either manually specifying offsets or using the
      "MetaModeOrientation" option.

    * Disabled interlaced modes over DisplayPort by default due to incomplete
      support in the GPU. Added "AllowDpInterlaced" mode validation token to
      override this default behavior and allow interlaced modes over
      DisplayPort protocol anyway.

======== Release 384 Entries ========

2018-03-28 version 384.130

    * Fixed a string concatenation bug that caused libGL to accidentally try to
      create the directory "$HOME.nv" rather than "$HOME/.nv" in some cases
      where /tmp isn't accessible.

    * Increased the version numbers of the GLVND libGL, libGLESv1_CM,
      libGLESv2, and libEGL libraries, to prevent concurrently installed
      non-GLVND libraries from taking precedence in the dynamic linker
      cache.

2018-01-04 version 384.111

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce MX130
        * GeForce MX110
        * GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with Max-Q Design
        * Quadro P500

    * Fixed a regression that prevented displays connected via some types of
      passive adapters (e.g. DMS-59 to VGA or DVI) from working correctly.
      The regression was introduced with driver version 384.98.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Quadro M2200 GPUs to enter the lowest available
      PowerMizer performance level when under load.

2017-11-02 version 384.98

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * P104-101
        * P106-090
        * Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB
        * Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some eDP G-SYNC displays to flicker at low
      refresh rates.

    * Fixed a bug that artificially limited the maximum pixel clock to 300 MHz
      when using certain more capable DisplayPort to HDMI adapters.

    * Fixed a bug that caused incorrect PCI topology reporting in nvidia-smi
      on Intel Skylake systems.

2017-09-21 version 384.90

    * Fixed a regression that caused display flickering at lower PowerMizer
      performance levels on some GPUs.

    * Fixed a regression that prevented console restoration after a VT switch
      on some GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a system hang when resuming from suspend
      with some GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that caused slow or stuttering frame rates in applications
      that use GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear while G-SYNC is active.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * Quadro P5200

    * Fixed a bug in the NVIDIA VDPAU driver that caused
      VdpVideoSurfaceGetBitsYCbCr() of H.265/HEVC content to have interlaced
      artifacts.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X driver to not correctly report the
      "BlendOrder" MetaMode token when querying the MetaMode through, e.g.,
      `nvidia-settings --query CurrentMetaMode`.

2017-08-18 version 384.69

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * Quadro P4000 with Max-Q Design

        * GeForce GT 1030
        * GeForce MX150
        * P104-100
        * P106-100

    * Fixed a bug that prevented changes to stereo eye assignment from
      getting applied from the nvidia-settings control panel.

2017-06-29 version 384.47

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to crash after
      calling glDeleteBuffers on VBOs that have been remapped with
      ARB_vertex_attrib_binding.

    * Fixed a bug that could sometimes cause OpenGL applications to
      lock up until the X server receives input.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to drop device BusID
      values when making changes to an existing X configuration file.

    * Fixed a regression that prevented nvidia-xconfig from querying
      some GPUs, e.g. when running `nvidia-xconfig -a`.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU playback to be corrupted when
      extended to coordinates beyond 16384 pixels.

    * Added support for a "Nearest" transform filter in the X driver.
      This causes the X driver to use nearest neighbor filtering when
      performing screen transformations.  The filter can be requested
      through the 'filter' argument to RandR's RRSetCrtcTransform,
      or through the 'ResamplingMethod' MetaMode token.

      modes 5 through 9.

2017-04-06 version 381.09

    * Fixed a bug that caused "nvidia-settings --query all" to print many
      duplicate entries.

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications to crash in some situations when
      calling glXMakeCurrent while OpenGL threaded optimizations were enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU applications to use the blit presentation
      queue when a previous VDPAU application didn't shut down cleanly.

    * Fixed hangs and crashes that could occur when an OpenGL context is created
      while the system is out of available memory.

    * Fixed a bug that caused corruption when OpenGL windows were moved or
      resized.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X screens that use Option "UseDisplayDevice"
      "none" to be resized to 640x480 when using "xrandr -s" to change the
      screen configuration.

    * Disabled OpenGL threaded optimizations by default, initially
      enabled in 378.09, due to various reports of instability.

    * Removed the X driver's logo splash screen and the corresponding NoLogo
      and LogoPath xorg.conf options.

    * Added the "ResamplingMethod" MetaMode option, adding support for
      bicubic resampling methods when scaling screen transformations
      are in use.  See the README for more details.

======== Release 378 Entries ========

2017-02-14 version 378.13

      after the library was renamed to libmutter-0.so.

2017-07-24 version 375.82

    * Fix a bug with GLX_EXT_buffer_age where incorrect buffer age values
      would be reported for SLI AFR configurations. In such configurations
      buffer age may now be greater than 3, the previous maximum buffer age.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause hanging and Xids when performing RandR
      transforms with Overlay and SLI enabled.

    * Improved handling of framebuffer console restore on systems booted in
      UEFI mode.

      calling eglInitialize() multiple times on X11-backed displays.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause rendering corruption on a
      monitor connected via DisplayPort upon a modeset event (for
      example, changing resolutions or power cycling the monitor).

    * Updated the display configuration page in the nvidia-settings
      control panel to accurately reflect HDMI 3D refresh rates.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to crash when
      VT switching between multiple X servers.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the system to become unresponsive after
      resuming from power management suspend/hibernate.  Additional

    * Added support for the RandR TILE property added in RandR 1.5.

    * Raised the on-disk OpenGL shader cache size from 64MB to 128MB. Refer to
      the "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" section of the
      driver README for details on how to select its location or disable it.

======== Release 370 Entries ========

2016-09-08 version 370.28

    * Fixed a bug that caused the driver to not set HDMI YUV 420 4K
      modes correctly on some TVs, such as the VIZIO D40u-D1.

    * Updated CurrentMetaMode reporting via the NV-CONTROL API to reflect
      whether ForceCompositionPipeline or ForceFullCompositionPipeline are
      set in the current MetaMode.

2016-08-15 version 370.23

    * Added the ability to over- and under-clock certain GeForce
      GPUs in the GeForce GTX 1000 series and later.  For GPUs that allow it,
      an offset can be applied to clock values in some clock domains of
      all performance levels.  This clock manipulation is done at the
      user's own risk.  See the README documentation of the "CoolBits"
      X configuration option for more details.

    * Added the "PixelShiftMode" MetaMode option, enabling support for 4K and
      8K pixel shift displays.  See the README for details.

======== Release 367 Entries ========

    * Updated the OpenGL driver to allow the use of integer format (SINT/UINT)
      color attachments with depth attachments in Frame Buffer Objects.

    * Fixed a bug in synchronization primitives shared between X and OpenGL.

2016-10-10 version 367.57

    * Fixed a bug that could prevent systems with GPUs configured in SLI from
      resuming correctly from ACPI S3/S4 sleep/hibernate states.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro P6000
        * Tesla P40
        * Quadro P5000

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-persistenced that caused it to incorrectly delete
      the PID file if a second instance of the daemon is started.

2016-08-23 version 367.44

    * Fixed a regression that caused applications using indirect GLX
      to crash.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * TITAN X (Pascal)
        * GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
        * GeForce GTX 1060 3GB

    * Fixed a regression introduced in 367.35 that caused the first
      modeset of the X server to display blank if the features requested
      in the X configuration file enabled the X driver's composition
      pipeline.  This would be triggered, e.g., by MetaMode tokens
      such as ForceCompositionPipeline, ForceFullCompositionPipeline,
      Rotation, Reflection, and Transform.

2016-07-15 version 367.35

    * Fixed a bug that caused X to crash when applying changes to the RandR
      CscMatrix property while VT-switched away from X.

    * Fixed a bug that caused a crash when exiting nvidia-settings on displays
      with 8 or 15 bit color depths.

2016-06-13 version 367.27

    * Added support for VDPAU Feature Set H to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.
      GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set H are capable of hardware-accelerated
      decoding of 8192x8192 (8k) H.265/HEVC video streams.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 1080
        * GeForce GTX 1070

2016-05-19 version 367.18

    * Fixed a bug that would cause OpenGL applications to crash when creating
      a context on one X display connection, then making it current with no
      associated drawable on another X display connection.  This fixes a crash
      when starting some versions of MATLAB.

    * Fixed OpenGL presentation to SDI through the GLX_NV_video_out and
      GLX_NV_present_video extensions, which was broken by the introduction
      of the nvidia-modeset kernel module in 358.09.

    * Fixed a bug that caused an incorrect offset to be applied when using
      the full composition pipeline on a display whose image has both a
      rotation and a ViewportOut offset applied.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-settings to crash on some systems
      when responding to events such as hotplugging DisplayPort devices.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause crashes in OpenGL applications which use
      glTextureView() with a non-zero minimum level.

    * Enhanced the Display Device information page in nvidia-settings with
      additional information for DisplayPort devices to reflect attributes
      which are specific to DisplayPort connections.

    * Fixed a bug which could cause deleted application profiles to appear
      when editing rules in the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug that caused hangs when a G-SYNC monitor is unplugged and a
      non-G-SYNC monitor is connected while G-SYNC is active.

    * Fixed a bug that caused "nvidia-modeset: ERROR: GPU:0: Activating G-SYNC
      failed" to be printed to the system log if a G-SYNC monitor is connected
      and stereo is enabled in xorg.conf on a configuration that doesn't support
      it.

    * Added the NV_robustness_video_memory_purge OpenGL extension, which
      allows applications to know when a mode switching or power event
      purged the contents of FBOs and buffer objects residing in video memory.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented HDMI 2.0 4K monitors from waking up
      from sleep or hot-re-plug.

======== Release 364 Entries ========

2016-04-22 version 364.19

2016-04-06 version 364.15

2016-03-21 version 364.12

    * Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect frame rate reporting on Quadro
      Sync configurations with multiple GPUs.

    * Improved X colormap precision from 8 significant bits to 11 on GeForce
      GPUs.  Quadro GPUs already used 11 bits of precision.

    * Added a new RandR property, CscMatrix, which specifies a 3x4 color-space
      conversion matrix.  The matrix is applied after the X colormap and before
      the gamma ramp.  This property is available on GF119 and newer GPUs.

    * Improved handling of the X gamma ramp on GF119 and newer GPUs.  On these
      GPUs, the RandR gamma ramp is always 1024 entries and now applies to the
      cursor and VDPAU or workstation overlays in addition to the X root window.

    * Improved the interactivity of applications that use a hardware cursor
      while G-SYNC is active.

======== Release 361 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to leak open file
      descriptors under some circumstances.

    * Fixed a crash in the OpenGL and OpenGL ES drivers in situations where
      some of the NVIDIA device nodes were not accessible.

    * Fixed a crash when querying the CUDA device handle of an EGLDevice in
      a system with multiple GPUs when the NVIDIA UVM device node or kernel
      module was not accessible.

    * Added support for querying clock values on Pascal GPUs.

    * Removed the Base Mosaic configuration option from nvidia-settings on
      systems where the feature is not actually supported.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-smi to report an inaccurate version
      number.

2016-05-24 version 361.45.11

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented flipping from being enabled on
      systems with multiple displays.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause applications to crash when using the 
      EGL_EXT_platform_device extension on a system with multiple GPUs.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Tesla M40 24GB
        * Quadro M5500
        * Quadro M2000

2016-03-30 version 361.42

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 920MX
        * GeForce 930MX
        * Quadro M6000 24GB

    * Fixed a regression that caused GPU exceptions and incorrect rendering
      when using pbuffers with EGLDevice.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when pairing glasses
      with the 3D Vision Pro transmitter on some systems.

    * Fixed a regression that caused the HSync and VSync mode timing polarity
      flags to be inverted.

2016-02-09 version 361.28

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce 945A

2016-01-13 version 361.18

2016-01-05 version 361.16

    * The OpenGL Vendor-Neutral Driver (GLVND) infrastructure is now included
      and supported by the NVIDIA GLX and OpenGL drivers.  This should not
      cause any visible changes in behavior for end users, but some internal
      driver component libraries have been renamed and/or moved as a result.
      These changes may affect scripts that rely on the presence of NVIDIA
      OpenGL driver components other than those specified in the Linux OpenGL
      ABI version 1.0, maintainers of alternative NVIDIA driver installation
      packages, and applications which rely on the presence of any non-
      OpenGL/GLX symbols in the libGL.so.1 library and its dependencies in
      any way.

      Please see:
      
        https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd

      For more information on the GLVND project.

      The Linux OpenGL ABI version 1.0 specification is available at:

        https://www.opengl.org/registry/ABI

    * Updated nvidia-installer to run ldconfig(8) and depmod(8) after
      uninstalling an existing driver, instead of only running these two
      commands when installing a new driver.

    * Removed the VDPAU wrapper and trace libraries libvdpau.so.1 and
      libvdpau_trace.so.1 from the driver package.  These libraries may be
      available via your distribution's package management system, or can be
      compiled from the sources available at:

        http://people.freedesktop.org/~aplattner/vdpau/

      Please see

        http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU/

      for more information.

======== Release 358 Entries ========

    * Fixed a regression, introduced in 358.09, that caused incorrect
      rendering of OpenGL stereo applications in combination with
      Quadro Sync on certain GPUs.

    * Fixed a regression, introduced in 358.09, that caused OpenGL
      stereo applications to hang when SLI AFR, SFR, or SLIAA modes
      were enabled.

    * Fixed a regression, introduced in 358.09, that caused the
      system to hang while launching OpenGL applications when some SLI
      Mosaic topologies were in use.

    * Fixed a bug, introduced in 358.09, that could cause a kernel crash
      when nvidia.ko and nvidia-modeset.ko have different versions. This
      could occur if an older driver package is installed after 358.09
      is installed.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some G-SYNC monitors to flicker on
      Kepler-based GPUs when running at low frame rates.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL or VDPAU applications to
      hang in Xinerama layouts which include multiple X screens that are
      driven by the same GPU.

    * Fixed a regression from 358.09 that caused G-SYNC monitors configured to
      use 3D Vision stereo to go blank and report an unsupported signal.

    * Fixed a regression from 358.09 that caused OpenGL applications that failed
      to negotiate permission to perform glXSwapBuffers via flipping to stop
      updating the screen.  This was triggered on Fedora 22 where the SELinux
      system policy prevents gnome-shell from communicating with the X server.

      Now, OpenGL applications that fail to negotiate flipping will fall back to
      glXSwapBuffers via blitting.

      See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1271401 for more details.

2015-10-12 version 358.09

    * Fixed a regression that reduced OpenGL performance on headless X
      server configurations.

    * Fixed a memory leak that occurred after destroying a GLXWindow which
      still has the current context attached to it.

    * Fixed a bug which caused EGL pbuffers to be created with both a front
      and back buffer, instead of a back buffer only, as is required for EGL.

    * Added a new kernel module, nvidia-modeset.ko.  This new driver
      component works in conjunction with the nvidia.ko kernel module
      to program the display engine of the GPU.

    * Reduced flickering and delays when transitioning into or out of G-SYNC
      mode.  As part of this change, monitors that have G-SYNC indicators in
      their on-screen displays will now always report that they are in G-SYNC
      mode.  The OpenGL G-SYNC visual indicator can be enabled in
      nvidia-settings to determine when G-SYNC is actually being used.

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL
      extension from OpenGL 3.0 has been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved official status:

      GL_EXT_draw_buffers2

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL 3.0 commands:

      BindBufferRangeNV
      BindBufferBaseNV
      BeginTransformFeedbackNV
      EndTransformFeedbackNV
      GetTransformFeedbackVaryingEXT
      TransformFeedbackVaryingsEXT

      which are part of the following extensions:

      GL_NV_transform_feedback
      GL_EXT_transform_feedback

      has been promoted from unofficial to ARB approved
      official status.

      With the above changes, GLX protocol for
      OpenGL 3.0 has been promoted from unofficial 
      to ARB approved official status.

    * Added a new system memory allocation mechanism for large
      allocations in the OpenGL driver.  This mechanism allows unmapping
      the allocation from the process when it is not in use, making more
      virtual address space available to the application.  It is enabled
      by default on 32 bit OpenGL applications with Linux 3.11+ and glibc
      2.19+.  Memory allocated this way will consume space in /dev/shm.
      Setting the environment variable __GL_DevShmPageableAllocations
      to 2 will disable this feature

======== Release 355 Entries ========

2015-08-31 version 355.11

    * Fixed a bug that could cause GPU exceptions when using glReadPixels()
      on the depth or stencil buffers of multisample windows while resizing
      or moving the windows.

2015-08-03 version 355.06

    * Fixed a bug that could cause data from one texture level to overwrite
      data from the next lowest level, when creating a texture view that
      did not include the higher of the two levels.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to
      crash when updating the display layout.

    * Corrected some erroneous reporting of support for GLX extensions:
      several extensions were being reported as supported for indirect
      GLX, which were in fact only supported under direct rendering.

    * Added support for the following EGL extensions:

          EGL_KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage
          EGL_NV_stream_consumer_gltexture_yuv

    * Added experimental full OpenGL support to the Linux compatibility EGL
      library.

    * Marked the DeleteUnusedDP12Displays option as deprecated.

      Version 1.5.0 of the X Resize and Rotate specification added a note that
      dynamically-created outputs will not be destroyed, so this option is
      deprecated and will be removed in a future driver release.

    * Added support for VDPAU profiles added in VDPAU 0.9:
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_BASELINE
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_CONSTRAINED_BASELINE
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_EXTENDED
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_PROGRESSIVE_HIGH
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_CONSTRAINED_HIGH

    * Fixed a bug that prevented more than one RandR output from sharing
      user-added modes.

    * Fixed a bug that caused application-specified swap intervals to be
      ignored on some screens when using Xinerama.

    * Fixed a bug that caused user-supplied RandR modes with nonsensical
      combinations of the +HSync, -HSync, +VSync, and -VSync flags to corrupt
      the mode list.

    * Added support to make an OpenGL 3.0 and above context current without
      making current to any drawable.

======== Release 352 Entries ========

2016-01-25 version 352.79

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro M500M
        * Tesla M4

    * Fixed a bug in the EGL driver where a mutex was unlocked more than
      once.  This triggers undefined behavior, and in particular, if
      lock elision is enabled in glibc, may result in a segmentation
      fault.

2015-11-16 version 352.63

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 940MX
        * GeForce 945M
        * Quadro M5000M
        * Quadro M4000M
        * Quadro M3000M
        * Quadro M2000M
        * Quadro M1000M
        * Quadro M600M
        * NVS 810
        * Tesla M40

    * Fixed a regression that prevented DPMS from working correctly on
      some DisplayPort displays.

    * Fixed a bug that could prevent X from starting when configured with
      multiple X screens, some of which scan out to display devices, and
      some of which do not.

2015-10-14 version 352.55

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 805A
        * GeForce GTX 960A

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications using OpenCL or CUDA with OpenGL
      interoperability to crash when using GLX indirect rendering.

2015-08-28 version 352.41

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 950
        * Quadro M4000
        * Quadro M5000

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to only display the top half of a video
      frame when decoding and displaying H.265/HEVC encoded video streams.

2015-07-28 version 352.30

    * Fixed a bug that caused poor video post-processing performance
      in VDPAU when operating on a large number of video streams
      simultaneously.

2015-06-15 version 352.21

    * Fixed a bug that caused the Display Configuration page of the
      nvidia-settings control panel to automatically generate layouts
      with multiple displays occupying the same position when enabling
      or disabling Base Mosaic.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to allow the use of the standard Display
      Configuration page when SLI Mosaic is enabled.

    * Added GLX Protocol support for the following OpenGL extensions:

      GL_ARB_copy_buffer
      GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object

    * Fixed a bug that caused a kernel crash if SLI Mosaic and G-SYNC were used
      at the same time on a configuration with more display devices connected to
      one GPU than another.

    * Updated the installer packages for FreeBSD and Solaris to install the
      libnvidia-ml management library, along with the nvidia-debugdump and
      nvidia-smi utility programs that depend upon it. These items have all
      been present within the FreeBSD and Solaris installer packages since
      driver release 349, but were not actually being installed.

2015-05-18 version 352.09

    * Added the ability to configure the swapping behavior for quad-buffered
      stereo visuals. The driver can be configured to independently swap
      each eye as it becomes ready, to wait for both eyes to complete
      rendering before swapping, or to allow applications to specify which
      of these two behaviors is preferred by setting the swap interval.
      This setting can be adjusted in the nvidia-settings control panel, or
      via the NV-CONTROL API.

    * Fixed a regression which caused the GPU fan status display to disappear
      from the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Added reporting of ECC error counts to the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented OpenGL sampler objects from
      being properly deallocated when destroying OpenGL contexts.

    * Fixed a bug that caused GLX_EXT_framebuffer_sRGB to incorrectly report
      sRGB support in 30 bit-per-pixel framebuffer configurations.

    * Added support for G-SYNC with sync-to-vblank disabled. This allows
      applications to use G-SYNC to eliminate tearing for frame rates below the
      monitor's maximum refresh rate but allow tearing above the maximum refresh
      rate in order to minimize latency.

      When G-SYNC is active and sync-to-vblank is enabled, the frame rate is
      limited to the monitor's maximum refresh rate.

    * GLSL gl_Fog.scale is now +infinity when gl_Fog.end equals gl_Fog.start.
      Previously, the value 0 was used, but this broke certain
      applications such as the game XIII running on Wine (Wine bug #37068).

    * Enabled G-SYNC by default when Unified Back Buffer (UBB) is disabled.

======== Release 349 Entries ========

2015-03-25 version 349.12

    * Added support for G-SYNC monitors when used together with non-G-SYNC
      monitors.  When G-SYNC is enabled, non-G-SYNC monitors will display with
      tearing.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when assigning an
      attribute whose value is a display ID on a system with multiple X screens.

    * Updated the reporting of in-use video memory in the nvidia-settings
      control panel to use the same accounting methods used in other tools
      such as nvidia-smi. nvidia-settings was not taking some allocations
      into account, e.g. framebuffer memory for the efifb console on UEFI
      systems, causing discrepancies in the values reported by different tools.

    * Added support for lossless H.264/AVC video streams to VDPAU.

    * Added support for VDPAU Feature Set F to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.
      GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set F are capable of hardware-accelerated
      decoding of H.265/HEVC video streams.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented GPU fan speed changes from getting reflected
      in the text box on Thermal settings page.

    * Added nvidia-settings commandline support to query the current and
      targeted GPU fan speed.

    * Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to enable a visual indicator that
      shows when G-SYNC is being used.  This is helpful for displays that don't
      indicate themselves whether they are operating in G-SYNC mode or normal
      mode.

      This setting can also be enabled by running the command line

        nvidia-settings -a ShowGSYNCVisualIndicator=1

    * Added support for YUV 4:2:0 compression to enable HDMI 2.0 4K@60Hz modes
      when either the display or GPU is incapable of driving these modes in
      RGB 4:4:4.  See NoEdidHDMI2Check in the README for details.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause multi-threaded applications to crash when
      multiple threads used the EGL driver at the same time.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Sync to VBlank to not work correctly with XVideo
      applications in certain configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the X driver from correctly interpreting
      some X configuration options when a display device name was given
      with a GPU UUID qualifier.

    * Added the NVIDIA Management Library (libnvidia-ml.so), and its associated
      utilities, nvidia-smi and nvidia-debugdump, to the driver packages for
      FreeBSD and Solaris.

======== Release 346 Entries ========

2015-09-01 version 346.96

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * Tesla K80

2015-07-21 version 346.87

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce 910M

2015-06-23 version 346.82

        * GeForce 940A
        * GeForce GTX 950A
        * GeForce GTX 980 Ti

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that caused the application to crash
      when saving the EDID to a file.

2015-05-12 version 346.72

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GPU

    * Fixed a bug causing loss of stereo synchronization in certain Quadro
      Sync framelock configurations.

    * Fixed Pixel Buffer Object operations when row length is less than
      width. GL_[UN]PACK_ROW_LENGTH can be set to a value lower than the
      width of the operation being carried out. The OpenGL specification
      allows for this (the source or destination lines will be overlapping).
      Previously, our implementation of Pixel Buffer Objects did not support
      this case and would throw an error.

2015-04-07 version 346.59

    * Fixed a bug that caused corruption when switching display modes in some
      applications that use transform feedback.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro K1200
        * Quadro M6000
        * GeForce 920M

2015-02-24 version 346.47

    * Fixed a bug that could cause quad-buffered stereo applications to
      crash when disabling displays.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause rendering corruption in GLX clients using
      PBOs and/or VBOs when using GLX indirect rendering.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Xinerama layouts which included X screens with
      'Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"' to be represented incorrectly in
      the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause glXSwapBuffers() to block for longer than
      necessary in multi-threaded GLX applications using the
      GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications using the NV_path_rendering
      extension to crash after a modeswitch event.

      driver, despite never having been supported.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the console from being restored after
      forcefully terminating X, on some GPUs with multiple DisplayPort
      monitors attached. This bug also subsequently prevented X from being
      started following the failed console restoration.

    * Updated the version of libvdpau shipped with the driver to 0.9.  This
      version honors the VDPAU_DRIVER_PATH environment variable and fixes a race
      condition if multiple threads call VdpDeviceCreateX11 simultaneously.  See

        http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/vdpau/2014-December/000274.html

      for more information.

    * Added accelerated support for r8g8b8a8, r8g8b8x8, b8g8r8a8 and b8g8r8x8
      RENDER formats.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to take advantage of GTK+ 3, when available.
      This is implemented by building the nvidia-settings user interface
      into separate shared libraries (libnvidia-gtk2.so, libnvidia-gtk3.so),
      and loading the correct one at run-time.

    * Added the nvidia-settings option --gtk-library to allow specifying
      the path of the directory containing the user interface library or
      the path and filename of the specific library to use.

      running games such as Far Cry 3 in Wine.

    * Fixed the EGL_KHR_stream_cross_process_fd extension.

    * Fixed rendering corruption that sometimes happened when calling 
      DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstance(),

      system configurations that disallow writing to executable memory.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings Makefiles to allow nvidia-settings
      to be dynamically linked against the host system's libjansson.
      This option can be enabled by setting the NV_USE_BUNDLED_LIBJANSSON
      Makefile variable to 0.  Please note that nvidia-settings requires
      libjansson version 2.2 or later.

    * Added initial support for G-SYNC monitors.  Additional details and system
      requirements can be found at:

        http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/g-sync

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused gamma ramp updates of the green
      channel at depth 15, on some recent GPUs, to be ignored.

======== Release 337 Entries ========

    * Enabled support for using Unified Back Buffer (UBB) and 3D Stereo with
      the composite extension on Quadro cards.  Using stereo with a composite
      manager requires a stereo-aware composite manager.  Otherwise, only the
      left eye of stereo applications will be displayed.  See the
      GLX_EXT_stereo_tree extension specification for more details.

2014-04-08 version 337.12

    * Updated the display configuration page in nvidia-settings to uniquely
      identify DisplayPort 1.2 monitors by displaying the monitor GUIDs.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause ECC settings to be displayed incorrectly
      in nvidia-settings when changing ECC settings on a multi-GPU system.

    * Removed the "OnDemandVBlankInterrupts" X configuration option: this
      option has been enabled by default since version 177.68 of the
      NVIDIA Unix driver, and the documentation had not been updated to
      reflect the new default value.

    * Fixed a bug that caused GPU errors when hotplugging daisy-chained
      DisplayPort 1.2 displays.

    * Updated the color correction settings page in the nvidia-settings
      control panel to reflect gamma changes made by other RandR clients
      while the control panel was already running.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of multiple simultaneous X servers
      on UEFI systems.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings source package to build libXNVCtrl when
      building nvidia-settings, instead of relying on a pre-built library.

    * Added the ability to over- and under-clock certain GeForce
      GPUs in the GeForce GTX 400 series and later.  For GPUs that allow it,
      an offset can be applied to clock values in some clock domains of
      some performance levels.  This clock manipulation is done at the
      user's own risk.  See the README documentation of the "CoolBits"
      X configuration option for more details.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 830M
        * GeForce 840M
        * GeForce 845M
        * GeForce GTX 850M

    * Updated the minimum required version of GTK+ from 2.2 to 2.4 for
      nvidia-settings.

      property documented in randrproto.txt:

        http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/randrproto/commit/?id=19fc4c5a72eb9919d720ad66734029d9f8e313b1

    * Reduced CPU utilization and GPU memory utilization of the NVIDIA
      EGL driver.

    * Added support for the following EGL extensions:
      - EGL_EXT_buffer_age;
      - EGL_EXT_client_extensions;
      - EGL_EXT_platform_base;
      - EGL_EXT_platform_x11.

    * Renamed the "Clone" setting of the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration
      option to "SamePositionAs", to make clear that this setting applies to
      the position only, and not to the resolution of modes in the MetaMode.

    * Added NV-CONTROL attribute NV_CTRL_VIDEO_ENCODER_UTILIZATION to query
      utilization percentage of the video encoder engine.

    * Added support for the GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.  For more
      details, see the extension specification:

        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/glx_delay_before_swap.txt

    * Report correct buffer sizes for RGB GLX visuals, GLXFBConfigs, and
      EGLConfigs.  Previously, RGB10 and RGB8 formats were reported as having 32
      bits, and RGB5 formats were reported as having 16 bits.  Now they are
      correctly reported as 30, 24, and 15 bit formats respectively as
      required by the GLX and EGL specifications.

======== Release 334 Entries ========

    * Fixed a regression in the NVIDIA kernel module which caused it to
      improperly dereference a userspace pointer. This potential security
      issue was initially reported to the public at:

        http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3922

      The regression did not affect NVIDIA GPU drivers before release 334.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL programs to hang after calling
      fork(2).

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 750 Ti
        * GeForce GTX 750
        * GeForce GTX 745
        * GeForce GTX TITAN Black

    * Added support for GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set E. See the README
      for details.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set E, VDPAU now supports more robust
      decode error handling at the cost of a minor performance impact.
      This can be disabled by setting the
      VDPAU_NVIDIA_DISABLE_ERROR_CONCEALMENT environment variable to 1.

    * Added support for application profile rule patterns which are logical
      operations of subpatterns. See the README for details.

    * Added support for a "findfile" application profile feature which
      allows the driver to apply profiles based on matching files in the
      same directory as the process executable. See the README for details.

    * Improved performance of OpenGL applications when used in conjunction
      with the X driver's composition pipeline.  The composition pipeline may
      be explicitly enabled by using the ForceCompositionPipeline or
      ForceFullCompositionPipeline MetaMode options, or implicitly enabled
      when certain features such as some XRandR transformations, rotation,
      Warp & Blend, PRIME, and NvFBC are used.

2014-02-08 version 334.16

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-settings to compute incorrect
      gamma ramps when adjusting the color correction sliders.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to allow the selection
      of display devices using RandR and target ID names when making
      queries targeted towards specific display devices.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some dropdown menus in the
      nvidia-settings control panel from working correctly on older
      versions of GTK+ (e.g. 2.10.x).

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to provide help text
      for application profile keys and suggestions for valid key names
      when configuring application profiles.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to populate the dropdown
      menu of stereo modes with only those modes which are available.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause applications using the OpenGL
      extension ARB_query_buffer_object to crash under Xinerama.

    * Fixed a bug that caused high pixelclock HDMI modes (e.g. as used
      with 4K resolutions) to be erroneously reported as dual-link in
      the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some DisplayPort 1.2 displays from being
      properly restored after a VT switch.

    * Renamed per GPU proc directories in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/ with GPU's
      bus location represented in "domain:bus:device.function" format.

    * Added 64-bit EGL and OpenGL ES libraries to 64-bit driver packages.

    * Changed format of "Bus Location" field reported in the
      /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information files from
      "domain:bus.device.function" to "domain:bus:device.function" to match
      the lspci format.

    * Fixed a bug in the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension where incorrect
      ages would be returned unless triple buffering was enabled.

    * Changed the driver's default behavior to stop deleting RandR 1.2 outputs
      corresponding to unused DisplayPort 1.2 devices.  Deleting these outputs
      can confuse some applications.  Added a new option,
      DeleteUnusedDP12Displays, which can be used to turn this behavior back on.

      This option can be enabled by running

        sudo nvidia-xconfig --delete-unused-dp12-displays

    * Improved support for the __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE and
      VDPAU_NVIDIA_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE environment variables in certain
      configurations.  Both environment variables will now recognize all
      supported display device names.  See "Appendix C. Display Device Names"
      and "Appendix G. VDPAU Support" in the README for more details.

    * Improved performance of the X driver when handling large numbers of
      surface allocations.

======== Release 331 Entries ========

2014-12-05 version 331.113

2014-10-08 version 331.104

    * Fixed a bug that could prevent 32-bit GPU-based applications from
      running correctly on 64-bit systems when using GPUs with very
      large memory-mapped I/O regions.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce 810M

    * Fixed a bug that could cause framelock status to be incorrectly
      reported in the nvidia-settings control panel on some multi-GPU
      framelock configurations.

    * Improved the performance of OpenGL applications that request a large

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if video memory is
      exhausted and the GPU does not support rendering to system memory.

    * Updated the behavior of the nvidia-settings PowerMizer Preferred
      Mode drop-down menu, to make the setting apply consistently
      across all GPUs in an SLI group.

    * Improved the robustness of the NVIDIA X driver in scenarios where
      GPU-accessible memory for allocating pixmaps was exhausted.

    * Added NV-CONTROL attributes to control the brightness of the illuminated
      logos on certain graphics boards.  For example, to turn off the
      illumination of the "GEFORCE GTX" lettering on the GeForce GTX 780, use

        nvidia-settings --assign GPULogoBrightness=0

    * Fixed a bug that prevented screen transformations from being
      applied properly when starting X.

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extensions from
      OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL 3.0 have been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved official status:

      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object
      GL_NV_conditional_render
      GL_ARB_map_buffer_range
      GL_EXT_texture_integer
      GL_ARB_vertex_array_object

      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object was the last piece of protocol
      needed to have official support for indirect rendering with
      all OpenGL 2.1 commands.

    * GLX Protocol for the miscellaneous OpenGL 3.0 commands not
      associated with specific extensions has also been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved status.

    * Deprecated display mask related configuration of display devices via
      NV-CONTROL and nvidia-settings.  Display target specifications should
      be used instead - A display target is one of the display's valid names,
      with an optional GPU or X screen qualifier.

    * Deprecated the following NV-CONTROL attributes:

      NV_CTRL_CONNECTED_DISPLAYS
      NV_CTRL_ENABLED_DISPLAYS
      NV_CTRL_ASSOCIATED_DISPLAYS
      NV_CTRL_NOTEBOOK_INTERNAL_LCD
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE

      Also, although NV_CTRL_PROBE_DISPLAYS is still operational, the return
      value has been deprecated and should not be used.

    * Added deprecation warning messages in nvidia-settings when deprecated
      attributes are used.  This also includes display mask usage.

2013-11-06 version 331.20

2013-10-22 version 331.17

    * Fixed a bug that prevented configuration files containing application
      profiles from being loaded when directories were present in the
      application profile configuration search path.

2013-10-04 version 331.13

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to fail to initialize when
      DisplayPort 1.2 monitors were assigned to separate X screens on the same
      GPU.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a deadlock when forking from OpenGL
      programs which use some malloc implementations, such as TCMalloc.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented Warp & Blend settings from being
      retained across display configuration changes.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some settings changes made via the
      nvidia-settings command line interface from being reflected in
      the nvidia-settings graphical user interface.

    * Changed the clipping behavior of the NVIDIA X driver on Trapezoids
      and Triangles for some RENDER operations to match the behavior in
      newer versions of Pixman:

      http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2013-April/002755.html

    * Fixed a bug in MetaMode tracking that could cause spurious error
      messages to be printed when attempting to add or delete Metamodes
      via NV-CONTROL.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the NVIDIA X driver to attempt to load the
      X11 "shadow" module unconditionally, even in situations where the
      driver had no need to use the module. This could result in the
      printing of spurious error messages, on X servers where the module
      was not present.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented display configuration changes made
      with xvidtune(1) from working correctly.

    * Fixed a bug that occasionally caused display corruption in GLX
      applications while changing the display configuration.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented glReadPixels from working correctly when
      reading from Pixel Buffer Objects over indirect rendering, when the
      image width is not a multiple of 4.

    * Added a new NV-CONTROL attribute, NV_CTRL_BACKLIGHT_BRIGHTNESS,
      for controlling backlight brightness.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from creating display
      device configuration pages for newly connected DisplayPort 1.2
      Multi Stream Transport downstream devices.

    * Added GPU utilization reporting to the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings control panel that prevented users
      from configuring stereo, when stereo was not already configured.

    * Added support for reporting the tachometer-measured fan speed on
      capable graphics boards via nvidia-settings and the NV-CONTROL API.
      The preexisting mechanism for reporting fan speed reports the speed
      of the fan as programmed by the driver.
      For example, `nvidia-settings --query=[fan:0]/GPUCurrentFanSpeedRPM`.

    * Fixed a regression that caused GPUs that do not support graphics to not
      appear in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort 1.2 multi-stream devices to stop
      working if they were unplugged and plugged back in while they were active
      in the current MetaMode.

    * Added support for the EGL API on 32-bit platforms.  Currently, the
      supported client APIs are OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0, and the only
      supported window system backend is X11.

    * Add a new option, AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration, which allows the X
      server to start even if no connected display devices are detected at
      startup.  This option can be enabled by running "sudo nvidia-xconfig
      --allow-empty-initial-configuration"

    * Added a system memory cache to improve the performance of certain X
      rendering operations that use software rendering fallbacks.  The X
      configuration option "SoftwareRenderCacheSize" may be used to configure
      the size of the cache.

    * Removed the "DynamicTwinView" X configuration option: dynamic
      reconfiguration of displays is always possible, and can no longer be
      disabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to display incorrect information
      in its display configuration page when all displays on an X screen were
      turned off.

======== Release 325 Entries ========

2013-08-05 version 325.15

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings control panel that could cause
      spurious messages about layout inconsistencies to be printed when
      changing the display layout while SLI is enabled.

2013-07-01 version 325.08

    * Fixed a bug that could cause display flickering after setting some
      scaling configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the status bar on the "PowerMizer" and
      "X Server XVideo Settings" pages in the nvidia-settings control
      panel from being updated when settings were changed by another
      NV-CONTROL client.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some UI elements to be duplicated in the
      nvidia-settings control panel following a VT switch on X server
      configurations with multiple NVIDIA X screens.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the creation of a mode via RandR with the
      same name as a previously created mode, even after the previous mode
      had been deleted.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that caused GTK+ theme colors to be
      ignored for some UI elements.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to write hostname-based color
      correction settings to the .nvidia-settings-rc configuration file, even
      when the "Include X Display Names in the Config File" option was unset.
      This could lead to a long delay when starting nvidia-settings, if a
      hostname saved to the configuration file failed to resolve.

    * Fixed a bug that exposed edge overlap controls on the SLI Mosaic
      page of nvidia-settings on edges where overlap was impossible.

    * Fixed a bug that caused some settings in the nvidia-settings control
      panel to be reset when re-probing displays.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications that use Frame Buffer
      Objects (FBOs) to crash following a mode switch (e.g. changing the
      resolution of a display or transforming it).

    * Fixed a memory leak that could be triggered by unloading libGL before
      destroying all GLX contexts.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause color correction settings to be applied to
      the wrong display when multiple displays are unplugged and then plugged
      back in again.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a spurious error message about a missing
      NV-GLX extension when performing indirect rendering from a GLX client
      with the NVIDIA client-side OpenGL libraries to a non-NVIDIA GLX server.

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug that prevented conditional rendering from the
      NV_conditional_render extension from correctly affecting CopyPixels.

    * Improved the rendering performance of complex gradients.

    * Added support for configuring SLI Mosaic and Base Mosaic in the "X Server
      Display Configuration" page of nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed an X driver bug where the RandR CRTC panning area and tracking
      area were not getting clamped to the current X screen size when
      the RandR CRTC transitioned from disabled to enabled.

    * Fixed an X driver bug where successful RandR X_RRSetScreenConfig
      requests would update the server's RandR 'lastSetTime' too far,
      potentially causing subsequent RandR requests to be unnecessarily
      rejected.

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused GPUs to become inaccessible via
      the NV-CONTROL X extension when no corresponding X screens could be
      initialized.

    * Generate a BadMatch error when applications attempt to create GLX
      pixmaps using glXCreatePixmap() or glXCreateGLXPixmapWithConfigSGIX()
      and the pixmap's depth doesn't match that of the specified GLXFBConfig.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to explicitly specify the direction of rotation
      for configuring per-display rotation configuration.

    * Honor a GPU UUID as the GPU qualifier for X configuration options that
      allow GPU qualifiers (e.g. "MetaModes").

    * Report GPU UUIDs in the X log when verbose logging is enabled in the
      X server.

    * Enabled conformant glBlitFrameBuffer() scissor test behavior by
      default. A driver-provided application profile enables the previous
      non-conformant behavior for applications that load libcogl, to work
      around a bug in older versions of libcogl.

      Application profiles can be added to enable the non-conformant behavior
      for other applications that depend upon it. See the "Known Issues"
      section of the README for more details.

======== Release 319 Entries ========

    * Updated nvidia-settings to use libjansson commit
      88aa6a9e30e7465196a737bd0f82eb17f393a120 from the repository at:

        git://github.com/akheron/jansson.git

      texture image was specified with glXBindTexImageEXT. In GNOME 3, this
      caused gnome-screenshot to produce garbled window screenshots.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when querying the current
      mode of disabled displays.

2013-06-25 version 319.32

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to report more detailed
      clocking information.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash after power-cycling
      displays connected behind a DisplayPort 1.2 Multi-Stream Transport hub.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-settings to crash when switching
      VTs after changing some settings.

      be reported as connected rather than disconnected.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause a DisplayPort device that was
      connected to one connector to turn off when a DisplayPort device on a
      different connector was connected or disconnected.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 710A
        * GeForce 720M

    * On Kepler-based GPUs, improved the appearance of the tearing that occurs

      expected, the tears should now appear as horizontal lines rather than more
      noticeable checkerboard or triangular shapes.

    * Added a "Prefer Consistent Performance" PowerMizer Mode to the
      nvidia-settings control panel, available on Quadro boards that
      support this feature.

2013-05-23 version 319.23

    * Added initial support for restoration of efifb consoles on UEFI
      systems where the primary display is driven over VGA or TMDS (e.g.
      DVI, HDMI, or LVDS).

    * Added support for the xorg.conf Monitor section options "Ignore",
      "Enable", "Primary", and "Rotate".  For example, to rotate a monitor
      identified by a specific EDID hash, one could add the following to
      /etc/X11/xorg.conf or a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d:

        Section "Monitor"
          Identifier "DPY-EDID-ee6cecc0-fa46-0c33-94e0-274313f9e7eb"
          Option "Rotate" "left"
        EndSection

      See the README and the xorg.conf(5) man page for more information.

    * Added an Underscan feature in the nvidia-settings X Server
      Display Configuration page which allows the configuration of an
      underscan border around the ViewPortOut.  This feature was
      formerly known as Overscan Compensation.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST

    * Added support for application profiles to the NVIDIA client-side GLX
      implementation. See the "Application Profiles" chapter of the README for
      more information.

    * Added the "PanningTrackingArea" and "PanningBorder" MetaMode attributes.

    * Added support for RandR 1.3 panning.

    * Improved performance when the Accel option is disabled.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings command line interface to accept display
      device names, as well as optional target qualifiers, e.g.

         nvidia-settings -q [DVI-I-0]/RefreshRate
         nvidia-settings -q [GPU-1.DVI_I-1]/RefreshRate

    * Updated the nvidia-settings command line interface to no longer assume
      the "X screen 0" target, when no target is specified in query and assign
      operations.  Instead, all valid targets of the attribute are processed.

    * Fixed a memory leak that occurred when destroying a GLX window
      but not its associated X window.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-installer to fail to delete
      directories created as part of a previous installation.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to report failures to remove installed
      files or restore backed up files with a single warning message,
      instead of a separate message for each individual failure.

    * Improved the performance of modesets in cases where the mode
      timings remained the same, but other parameters of the mode
      configuration, such as the ViewPort or panning domain, changed.

    * Fixed an issue with RENDER convolution filters.  The driver will
      no longer normalize filter kernels before accelerating them.

    * Improved debuggability of the NVIDIA OpenGL libraries by
      including proper stack unwinding information on all supported
      architectures.

    * Fixed a bug that caused RENDER Pictures to be sampled
      incorrectly when using nearest filtering in some cases.

    * Added support for the RandR "Border" and "BorderDimensions" Output
      properties, which can be used to configure the ViewPortOut of an
      RandR output.  This is functionally equivalent to the "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode token.

    * Fixed a bug where RRGetCrtcInfo could report incorrect size
      information when an RandR output has a custom ViewPortIn.

    * Further improve performance of some versions of HyperMesh with
      Quadro GPUs.

    * Added a VDPAU page to the nvidia-settings control panel, to display
      information about the decoding capabilities of VDPAU-capable GPUs.

    * Added support for dynamic mode management through RandR, e.g. via
      the --newmode, --rmmode, and --delmode options in xrandr(1).

    * Increased the number of pages that can be shared across multiple
      processes in the x86 build of libnvidia-glcore.so, by reducing its
      R_386_PC32 relocation count.

    * Fixed a bug that caused XVideo applications to receive BadAlloc errors
      after VT switches and mode switches that occurred while a composite
      manager was running.

    * Removed the X driver's support for "CursorShadow".

      objects.

2012-12-11 version 313.09

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to re-probe displays when VT-switching to
      X, to allow reporting of hotplug events when displays are connected
      or disconnected while VT-switched away from X.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following extension and core commands.

      GL_ARB_vertex_array_object
      OpenGL 3.0 commands ClearBufferfi, ClearBufferfv, ClearBufferiv,
      ClearBufferuiv and GetStringi.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the cursor shadow to be clipped to 32x32
      pixels, even on Kepler GPUs that support a 256x256 cursor image.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some cursor image updates from taking
      effect on displays with rotation or other transformations applied.

    * Fixed cursor alpha blending artifacts on displays with rotation
      or other transformations applied.

    * Added support for the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension.

    * Improved the performance of glDrawPixels() by up to 450% when the pixel
      data is of type GL_BYTE.

======== Release 310 Entries ========

2013-05-08 version 310.51

    * Updated the FreeBSD driver Makefiles to use LOCALBASE instead of
      the deprecated X11BASE.

    * Fixed a bug where RRGetCrtcInfo could report incorrect size
      information when an RandR output has a custom ViewPortIn.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause an X server crash when performing
      a modeset (e.g. changing resolutions, transformation settings, or
      display layout) when some connected display devices are disabled.

    * Augmented the resolution drop-down in the display configuration
      page of nvidia-settings with "implicit resolutions": for common
      resolutions, if a mode with that resolution is not available for
      a display device, that resolution will be simulated through
      MetaMode ViewPort scaling.

2013-03-08 version 310.40

    * Reduced the amount of time needed to establish framelock in some
      stereo configurations with many monitors.

2013-01-21 version 310.32

    * Fixed a bug when enabling framelock between displays connected to
      the same GPU as other displays with different refresh rates, which
      caused the latter to be incorrectly assigned to the framelock group.

    * Updated the reporting of HDMI 3D framerates and pixel clocks to be
      more consistent with how they are reported by HDMI 3D displays.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented rotation controls in the nvidia-
      settings control panel from working after changing resolutions.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause applications using GL_NV_vdpau_interop
      to crash during mode switches.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL applications to crash
      while compiling shaders.

    * Added a kernel module parameter, "NVreg_EnablePCIeGen3", which can be
      used to enable PCIe gen 3 when possible. Note that on many systems
      where the NVIDIA driver does not allow PCIe gen 3 by default,
      stability problems can be expected when this option is enabled: users
      should do so at their own risk.

    * Fixed a VDPAU bug that could cause the X server to hang when decoding
      some corrupted video streams.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro K600

        * Quadro K4000
        * GeForce GTX 680MX
        * Tesla K20Xm

    * Renamed VGX products to GRID products in the "Supported NVIDIA GPU
      Products" list.

    * Added support for X.org xserver ABI 14 (xorg-server 1.14).

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that could cause the wrong
      resolution to be set in basic mode for setups based on one
      display per X screen.

    * Fixed libnvidia-encode.so library dependency by linking it with
      libnvcuvid.so.1 instead of libnvcuvid.so while creating it.

    * Improved performance of OpenGL framebuffer object binds with Xinerama
      enabled by 2000-3000% when the application's windows do not span screen
      boundaries.

    * Fix performance issues when using some versions of HyperMesh with Quadro
      GPUs.

    * Implemented workarounds for two Adobe Flash bugs by applying libvdpau
      commit ca9e637c61e80145f0625a590c91429db67d0a40 to the version of libvdpau
      shipped with the NVIDIA driver.

    * Fixed an issue which affected the performance of moving windows of VDPAU

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object OpenGL extension.

    * Added support for HDMI 3D Stereo with Quadro Kepler and later GPUs. See
      the documentation for the "Stereo" X configuration option in the README
      for details.

    * Added experimental support for OpenGL threaded optimizations, available
      through the __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS environment variable. For more
      information, please refer to the "Threaded Optimizations" section in
      chapter "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" of the README.

    * Improved performance and responsiveness of windowed OpenGL applications
      running inside a Unity session.

2016-09-26 version 304.132

2015-11-16 version 304.131

    * Fixed a bug that could cause texture corruption in some OpenGL
      applications when video memory is exhausted by a combination of
      simultaneously running graphical and compute workloads.

    * Added support for X.Org xserver ABI 20 (xorg-server 1.18).

2015-08-31 version 304.128

    * Removed libvdpau and libvdpau_trace from the NVIDIA driver package.
      VDPAU is not supported on the legacy hardware supported on the
      release 304 legacy driver branch. The libvdpau_nvidia vendor library
      is still included, so users who wish to use VDPAU with newer hardware
      that still works with release 304 drivers may install libvdpau from
      packages provided by the OS vendor where available, or from the source
      code available at:

      http://people.freedesktop.org/~aplattner/vdpau/

2014-12-05 version 304.125

    * Added support for X.Org xserver ABI 19 (xorg-server 1.17).

    * Updated the driver installation makefiles to use LOCALBASE instead of
      X11BASE to determine the default installation paths.

2014-07-10 version 304.123

    * Fixed an interaction problem with xserver 1.15 that occasionally caused
      OpenGL applications to continue rendering when they are minimized or
      unmapped.

      graphics boards that use external DisplayPort encoders, such as the Quadro
      FX 4800.

2014-03-11 version 304.121

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the NVIDIA implementation of the Xinerama
      extension protocol requests from being used when RandR was enabled.

2014-01-23 version 304.119

    * Fixed a crash when using WebGL in Firefox with a Geforce 6 GPU.

2013-12-11 version 304.117

    * Added support for X.org xserver ABI 15 (xorg-server 1.15).

2013-11-06 version 304.116

    * Updated the NVIDIA OpenGL driver to write temporary files to $TMPDIR
      if it is set, instead of unconditionally writing to /tmp.

    * Updated a fallback of writing temporary files to $HOME/.nvidia to
      use $HOME/.nv instead, as the latter path is already used for other
      NVIDIA driver related files.

2013-08-08 version 304.108

    * Fixed a bug that could cause system instability when querying
      hardware information via sysctl(8) on FreeBSD.

2013-04-02 version 304.88

    * Fixed CVE-2013-0131: NVIDIA UNIX GPU Driver ARGB Cursor Buffer
      Overflow in "NoScanout" Mode.  This buffer overflow, which occurred
      when an X client installed a large ARGB cursor on an X server
      running in NoScanout mode, could cause a denial of service (e.g.,
      an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve
      arbitrary code execution.

      For more details, see:
      http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3290

2013-03-04 version 304.84

    * Fixed a bug that could lead to rendering corruption after an X
      server generation (i.e., leaving an X server running after all
      of its clients have exited).

    * Removed a spurious dependency on libpangox from the nvidia-settings
      binary shipped as part of the driver package.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when performing
      an RandR 1.0 rotation (e.g., `xrandr --orientation left`) after
      unplugging the last connected monitor.

    * Fixed font rendering performance and corruption problems on X servers with
      back-ported support for the new glyph cache functionality added to Pixman
      0.27.

    * Fixed a potential X server crash during initialization, when a 
      graphics card with a TV connector has no TV connected.

    * Added a new X configuration option, "UseHotplugEvents", to allow the
      suppression of RandR events when adding or removing non-DisplayPort
      displays. See the "X Config Options" appendix of the README for details.

2012-11-06 version 304.64

    * Fixed a regression in backlight control functionality on some
      notebook configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the display device / X screen
      selection menu from being displayed in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented X driver gamma manipulation from working
      after a VT-switch on some configurations.

    * Added the option "--output-file" to nvidia-bug-report.sh to allow
      specifying a custom filename for the log file.

    * Fixed a hang when using OpenGL programs with some SLI Mosaic
      configurations on pre-Fermi GPUs.

    * Added sections to the "Supported NVIDIA GPU Products" list for NVS,
      Tesla, and VGX products.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * VGX K1
        * VGX K2
        * Tesla K20c
        * Tesla K20m

2012-10-18 version 304.60

    * Fixed a bug that caused the EIZO FlexScan SX2762W monitor to remain blank
      when connected via DisplayPort.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to save and restore per-monitor color correction
      settings when RandR 1.2 or later is available.

    * Fixed a bug that caused too many display devices to appear in the X Screen
      page of nvidia-settings when SLI is enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications to stop rendering or the X server to
      hang in Xinerama configurations when windows were moved, resized, mapped,
      or unmapped.

    * Fixed a bug that caused poor OpenGL performance on GeForce 6 and 7 PCI
      cards.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that made it report the status of ECC
      configuration incorrectly.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a display was put into
      DPMS off mode and subsequently re-enabled while screen transformations are
      in use.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X Resize and Rotate extension to be enabled
      when Xinerama is enabled.  These two X extensions are incompatible and
      having them both enabled can confuse window managers such as KDE's kwin.
      RandR is now correctly disabled when Xinerama is enabled.

    * Fixed a bug causing OpenGL stereo applications to not work properly
      when using passive stereo modes 5 through 9 on Quadro Fermi and newer
      GPUs.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to report Dedicated GPU Memory (i.e., the
      memory dedicated exclusively to the GPU) and Total GPU Memory (i.e.,
      Dedicated GPU Memory plus any TurboCache(TM)-accessible system memory)
      separately on the GPU information page.

    * Added reporting of the current utilization of Dedicated GPU Memory to
      the GPU information page of nvidia-settings.

    * Added support for the "Backlight" RandR output property for
      configuring the brightness of some notebook internal panels.

      revealing: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1057000

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to sometimes attempt
      to write a log file in a nonexistent directory.

    * Fixed a bug that caused incorrect input transformation after resizing
      an NVIDIA X screen with xserver ABI 12 (xorg-server 1.12) or newer.

    * Fixed a bug that caused GLX to leak memory when Xinerama is
      enabled.

    * Added support for the new Quadro Sync board for Quadro Kepler GPUs.
      See the "Configuring Frame Lock and Genlock" chapter in the README
      for details.

    * Fixed an X server crash on X.Org xserver 1.13 when it is compiled
      without support for DRI2.

    * Fixed a regression that broke color controls on older X servers.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the display layout area of the
      nvidia-settings control panel to be laid out incorrectly.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented panning from working correctly after a
      mode switch on some X servers with support for cursor constraining.

    * Gamma ramp and colormap adjustments now apply correctly when screen
      transformations such as rotation and keystone correction are in use.

2012-09-11 version 304.48

    * Fixed RandR per-CRTC gamma persistence across mode-switches and
      VT-switches.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to sometimes hang in response to
      input events.

    * Fixed a reduction in rendering performance for core X11 rendering on
      certain GPUs that occurred in the 290.* series of releases.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented PowerMizer from working correctly on
      some boards with GDDR5 memory, such as some GeForce GT 240 SKUs.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 660
        * GeForce GTX 650

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to not animate properly
      when a rotation or a transformation was applied on some older X
      server versions.

    * Enabled FXAA with Unified Back Buffers.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the "Reset Hardware Defaults" button in
      the Display Settings page of nvidia-settings from being activated.

2012-08-27 version 304.43

    * Fixed a bug that caused pre-release versions of X.Org xserver 1.13 to
      crash when certain GLX operations were performed, such as when starting
      Firefox.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to hang when expanding the YouTube
      Flash Player.

    * Fixed a bug that caused gnome-settings-daemon to revert display
      configuration changes made by nvidia-settings.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to use RandR per-CRTC gamma control, when
      available.  When controlling an X server with support for RandR 1.2,
      nvidia-settings will display the color correction widget as a tab
      within each display device page, instead of a per-X screen color
      correction page.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the display palette from being updated
      immediately after an application called XStoreColors.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 660 Ti
        * Quadro K5000
        * Quadro K5000M
        * Quadro K4000M
        * Quadro K3000M
        * NVS 510

    * Added the ability to select and move X screens in the "X Server Display
      Configuration" page of nvidia-settings via Ctrl-(Left)Click + Drag

2012-08-13 version 304.37

    * Removed the ability to enable SLI on GPUs with ECC enabled.

    * Fixed several bugs that prevented some RandR transform geometries from
      being applied.

    * Fixed a bug that caused frequent hangs or crashes on some systems.

    * Fixed a bug that would cause corruption and performance issues in certain
      OpenGL applications such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent on GeForce 6 and 7
      GPUs.

2012-08-03 version 304.32

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications that use DirectColor visuals, such as
      Enemy Territory: Quake Wars and Braid, to appear in shades of blue instead
      of the correct colors.

    * Modified handling of RRSetScreenSize requests to ignore requests that
      do not actually resize the screen.  This reduces screen flicker in certain
      cases when using GNOME.

    * Added a new option, "--disable-nouveau" to nvidia-installer. This
      option changes the action that is chosen by default when Nouveau
      is detected by nvidia-installer. If the "--disable-nouveau" option
      is set, then the default will be to attempt to disable Nouveau when
      it is detected; otherwise, no attempt will be made unless requested.

2012-07-30 version 304.30

    * Added support for xserver ABI 13 (xorg-server 1.13).

    * Added support for RandR per-CRTC gamma manipulation through the
      RandR 1.2 RRGetCrtcGammaSize, RRGetCrtcGamma, and RRSetCrtcGamma
      requests.

    * Fixed a bug that caused RRSetOutputPrimary requests to incorrectly
      generate BadValue errors when setting the primary output to None.  This
      caused gnome-settings-daemon to crash after changing the screen
      configuration in response to a display hotplug or the display change
      hot-key being pressed.

    * Fixed a problem where RENDER Glyphs operations would exhibit severe
      performance issues in certain cases, such as when used with gradients
      by Cairo and Chromium.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X to hang when resuming certain DisplayPort
      display devices (such as Apple brand mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI
      adapters) from power-saving mode.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * Tesla K10

    * Fixed a bug that caused an X screen to be extended to Quadro SDI Output
      devices by default.  An X screen will still use an SDI Output device if
      it is the only display device available.  To use a SDI Output device on
      an X screen with other display devices available, include the SDI Output
      device with either the "UseDisplayDevice" or "MetaMode" X configuration
      options.

    * Updated X11 modeline validation such that modes not defined in a
      display device's EDID are discarded if the EDID 1.3 "GTF Supported"
      flag is unset or if the EDID 1.4 "Continuous Frequency" flag is
      unset.  The new "AllowNonEdidModes" token for the ModeValidation
      X configuration option can be used to disable this new check.

    * Fixed a bug, introduced in the 295.xx release series, with EDID
      detection on some laptop internal panels.  This bug caused the
      laptop internal panel to show six small copies of the desktop.

    * Added support for FXAA, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing. Using regular
      anti-aliasing modes or Unified Back Buffers with FXAA is not currently
      supported.

2012-07-13 version 304.22

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 680M
        * Quadro K1000M
        * Quadro K2000M

    * Enhanced the functionality of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
      configuration option:

      * Implicit MetaModes will be added for the primary display device,
        even if multiple display devices are in use when X is initialized.

      * Implicit MetaModes will be added for common resolutions, even
        if there isn't a mode with that resolution in the mode pool of
        the display device.

      * Extended the syntax of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
        configuration option, e.g., to control which display device is
        used for creation of implicit MetaModes.

      See the description of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X configuration
      option in the README for details.

    * Modified the handling of the RandR 1.0/1.1 requests RRGetScreenInfo
      and RRSetScreenConfig (e.g., `xrandr -q --q1` and `xrandr --size ...`
      and `xrandr --orientation ...`) such that they operate on MetaModes.
      This was the behavior in NVIDIA X driver versions 295.xx and
      earlier, but 302.xx releases altered the handling of these RandR
      1.0/1.1 requests to operate on a single RandR output's modes.

    * With the above changes to IncludeImplicitMetaModes and RandR 1.0/1.1
      handling, fullscreen applications (e.g., SDL-based applications,
      Wine), should have more resolutions available to them, and should
      interact better with multiple monitor configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause G8x, G9x, and GT2xx GPUs to display a black
      screen or corruption after waking up from suspend.

    * Fixed several bugs that could cause some OpenGL programs to hang
      when calling fork(3).

    * Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that caused the results of ProbeDisplays
      queries made with the --display-device-string option to be formatted
      incorrectly.

    * Improved the responsiveness of updates to the nvidia-settings
      control panel when displays are hotplugged.

    * Fixed a bug that caused display corruption when setting some
      transforms, especially when panning a transformed display.

    * Fixed a bug that caused extra RandR events to be generated the first
      time a display is hotplugged.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X11 modelines with '@' in their names to
      be rejected.

    * Added support for DisplayPort 1.2 branch devices, which allow multiple
      displays to be connected to a single DisplayPort connector on a graphics
      board.

    * Fixed a bug that caused most OpenGL texture uploads to be slow when
      the context was bound rendering to an RGB overlay drawable.

    * Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work after restarting
      the X server on some MCP7x (IGP) GPUs.

    * Updated the X configuration option "UseDisplayDevice" to honor the
      value "none" on any GPU.

    * Added RandR output properties _ConnectorLocation, ConnectorNumber,
      ConnectorType, EDID, _GUID, and SignalFormat.  See the README for details
      on these properties.

    * Extended support for Base Mosaic to all G80+ SLI configurations with up
      to three displays.

    * Fixed a bug that caused some monitors to fail to wake from DPMS suspend
      mode when multiple DisplayPort monitors were attached to one GPU.

    * Removed controls for XVideo attributes from the "X Server XVideo
      Settings" page of the nvidia-settings control panel. XVideo attributes
      can be configured in XVideo player applications, or through utilities
      such as xvattr.

    * Fixed a bug that caused all ports on an XVideo adaptor to share
      color correction settings.

    * Removed support for the following X configuration options:

         SecondMonitorHorizSync
         SecondMonitorVertRefresh
 
       Similar control is available through the NVIDIA HorizSync and
       VertRefresh X configuration options.  Please see the NVIDIA driver
       README for details.

======== Release 302 Entries ========

    * Added support for desktop panning when rotation, reflection,
      or transformation is applied to a display device (either through
      RandR or through the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be
      ignored in that case.

2012-06-15 version 302.17

    * Made nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder consistent with the RRSetOutputPrimary
      and RRGetOutputPrimary RandR requests: changes to either
      nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder or RandR OutputPrimary will be reflected in
      the other.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between RandR 1.2, ConstrainCursor,
      and panning that prevented panning from working properly.

    * Fixed a bug that caused RandR RRNotify_CrtcChange events to not
      be generated when switching between MetaModes with the same total
      size but different layout of display devices.  This bug caused
      some window managers to not update their layouts in response to
      switching same-sized MetaModes.

    * Added an "EDID" property to RandR 1.2 outputs.  This property contains the
      binary contents of the connected monitor's extended display identification
      data, which allows applications such as the GNOME display properties
      dialog to query information about it.

    * Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work on some GPUs
      after querying the RandR configuration (e.g., `xrandr -q`).

    * Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfo" X configuration option to report
      the layout of multiple display devices within an X screen.  This is
      enabled by default.  When disabled on X servers with RandR 1.2
      support, the NVIDIA X driver will report one screen-sized region.
      When disabled on X servers without RandR 1.2 support, no Xinerama
      information will be reported.  For backwards compatibility, the
      "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" option disables nvidiaXineramaInfo.

    * Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" is kept as a synonym for
      "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder".

    * Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride" is kept as a synonym
      for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride".

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some SLI Mosaic topologies.

    * Added the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration option as a
      replacement for "TwinViewOrientation".  "TwinViewOrientation"
      is kept as a synonym for "MetaModeOrientation", for backwards
      compatibility.

2012-05-19 version 302.11

    * Added support for calculating the physical size and DPI of each
      RandR 1.2 Output using the EDID Detailed Timing Description.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented a workaround for the invalid EDID in certain
      AUO laptop flat panels from being applied, leading to an 800x600 desktop
      repeated several times across the screen.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the link configuration of DisplayPort devices to
      be reported incorrectly in nvidia-settings.

2012-05-02 version 302.07

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to leak file descriptors
      when calling exec() on themselves.

    * Fixed rendering corruption at the start of new X server generation.

    * Added X driver support for RandR 1.2 and RandR 1.3.  See "Support
      for the X Resize and Rotate Extension" in the README for details.

    * Extended the MetaMode X configuration option syntax with the
      following new attributes:

        "Rotation"    : specifies the display device's rotation
        "Reflection"  : specifies the display device's reflection
        "Transform"   : specifies a 3x3 transformation matrix to be
                        applied to the display device
        "ViewPortOut" : specifies the region of the mode in which to
                        display pixels
        "ViewPortIn"  : specifies the size of the region in the X screen
                        to display in the ViewPortOut

      For example, "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select { Rotation=left }".
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.

    * Removed the "TwinView" X configuration option; the functionality
      it provided is now enabled by default.

      Previously, the NVIDIA X driver only enabled one display device
      for an X screen unless "TwinView" was enabled.  Now, the NVIDIA
      X driver enables, by default, as many display devices as the
      GPU supports driving simultaneously.  To limit how many display
      devices are driven by an X screen, use the "UseDisplayDevice"
      X configuration option.

    * Added a "CurrentMetaMode" attribute to the nvidia-settings command
      line, to query and set the current MetaMode.

      As an example, these two commands are equivalent:

        xrandr --output DVI-I-2 --mode 1280x1024 --pos 0x0             --output DVI-I-3 --mode 1920x1200 --pos 1280x0

        nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=            "DVI-I-2: 1280x1024 +0+0, DVI-I-3: 1920x1200 +1280+0"

    * Removed overscan compensation configurability from NV-CONTROL and
      nvidia-settings. This can be configured, with finer granularity,
      through the ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut MetaMode attributes.
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.

    * Altered mode validation such that for digital display devices
      the X driver only allows, by default, modes which are reported in
      the EDID.  Previously, the NVIDIA X driver allowed other modes,
      but implicitly scaled those other modes to one of the EDID modes.

      Now, only the modes in the EDID are validated and the X driver
      does not do any implicit scaling.  Any desired scaling can be
      configured explicitly through the new "ViewPortIn" and "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode attributes.  See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices
      on One X Screen" in the README for details.

    * Removed Flat Panel Scaling configurability in nvidia-settings.
      Any desired scaling can be configured through the new "ViewPortIn"
      and "ViewPortOut" MetaMode attributes.

    * Hotplug events (specifically, the RRNotify_OutputChange RandR
      event) are now generated when display devices are connected and
      disconnected from the GPU.  Many desktop environments automatically
      resize the X desktop in response to these events.

    * Added display device name aliases, such that X configuration options
      that use display device names can refer to a display device by one of
      several names, including the RandR Output name for the display
      device.  The X log reports the list of aliases for each display device.

    * Updated EDID parsing to include more complete support for EDID 1.4
      and more recent versions of CEA-861.

    * Removed the "Rotate" X configuration option.  This was used to
      statically rotate the X screen.  Its functionality is replaced by
      the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2 rotation support.
      See the README for details.

    * Removed the "RandRRotation" X configuration option.  This enabled
      configurability of X screen rotation via RandR 1.1.  Its functionality
      is replaced by the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2
      rotation support.  See the README for details.

    * Removed support for the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_TARGET
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_METHOD
        NV_CTRL_DFP_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_FRONTEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_BACKEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_OVERSCAN_COMPENSATION
        NV_CTRL_FLATPANEL_BEST_FIT_RESOLUTION

    * Improved rendering performance for RENDER bitmap text.

    * Enabled the OpenGL "Sync to VBlank" option by default.

    * Added a new option, --restore-original-backup, to nvidia-xconfig.
      nvidia-xconfig creates a backup of the original X configuration
      file when modifying an X configuration file that does not appear
      to have been previously modified by nvidia-xconfig. This option
      restores a backup of the original X configuration file, if such
      a backup is found.

    * Expose the following additional FSAA modes via NV-CONTROL,
      nvidia-settings, and through X visuals and GLXFBConfigs:

        16X multisample FSAA on all GeForce GPUs

        Coverage sample FSAA on G80 and above GeForce GPUs

        32X multisample FSAA on G80 and above Quadro GPUs

        64X multisample FSAA on Fermi and above Quadro GPUs

    * Enabled conformant texture clamping by default in OpenGL.

    * Removed support for the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:

        NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y

    * Added a new, higher resolution icon for nvidia-settings.

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver's handling of X configuration options
      that affect an entire GPU, not just a particular X screen running
      on a GPU (e.g., "NoPowerConnectorCheck"): for such X configuration
      options, the X driver will now honor the option on any of the X
      screens configured on the GPU.  Prior to this change, the NVIDIA
      X driver only honored such options on the first X screen configured
      on a GPU.

    * Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to control the texture clamping
      attribute.  When the box is checked, OpenGL textures are clamped
      according to the OpenGL specification.  When it is unchecked, GL_CLAMP
      is remapped to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for borderless 2D textures.

    * Removed the "Display" and "X Screen" tabs from the "X Server Display
      Configuration Page" of nvidia-settings, and added a new "Selection"
      dropdown menu for selecting X screens or display devices.  This
      makes it easier to select X screens/Displays that are hidden.

======== Release 295 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that caused frequent hangs or crashes on some systems.

2012-08-07 version 295.71

    * Implemented hotfix for a privilege escalation vulnerability reported on

      active stereo content to be inverted on some display devices.

2012-05-03 version 295.49

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * GeForce GTX 690

    * Fixed a problem where starting, stopping, and moving OpenGL application
      windows was very slow on Quadro FX 4600, Quadro FX 5600, GeForce 8800
      GTX, GeForce 8800 GTS, and GeForce 8800 Ultra.

    * Fixed an OpenGL performance regression which affected Geforce 6 and
      Geforce 7 series integrated GPUs.

2012-04-11 version 295.40

    * Closed a security vulnerability which made it possible for attackers to
      reconfigure GPUs to gain access to arbitrary system memory. For further
      details, see: http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3109

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to occasionally fail to turn
      back on after the system is resumed from suspend.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GT 630M
        * GeForce GT 620

    * Fixed a VDPAU bug where decoding some H.264 streams would cause hardware
      errors on lower-end products, resulting in corruption and poor
      performance.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop working after monitors
      are hotplugged on GeForce GT 520.

    * Fixed a behavior change that prevented ConnectedMonitor from being usable

        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y

      as deprecated.  They will be removed in a future release.  To display
      an X screen over GVO, it is recommended to use GVO with MetaModes,
      instead.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to not be listed in
      Xorg.*.log.  For example, if only DisplayPort devices are attached, the
      log file would contain

        (--) NVIDIA(0): Connected display device(s) on NVIDIA GPU at PCI:2:0:0
        (--) NVIDIA(0):     none

    * Added support for 3D Vision ready displays that have a NVIDIA 3D Vision
      infrared emitter built inside the panel itself.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to crash with some libc
      versions, such as eglibc 2.15.

    * Fixed a bug that caused HDMI audio to stop working on AppleTV devices when
      an X server was started.

2012-02-13 version 295.20

    * Fixed a bug that caused black areas to appear on the back faces of

    * Added a "--no-opengl-files" option to nvidia-installer to allow
      installation of the driver without OpenGL files that might conflict
      with already installed OpenGL implementations.

    * Split the DFP configuration page in nvidia-settings into multiple
      tabs, allowing the controls to be displayed on smaller screens.

2012-01-31 version 295.17

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some OpenGL applications (including
      desktop environments like KDE and GNOME Shell) to hang.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the internal panel from working on some
      laptops with GeForce 7 series GPUs.

2011-12-27 version 295.09

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug where using display lists on Fermi-based GPUs
      could result in missing rendering in some cases.

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug that caused incorrect rendering when using
      framebuffer objects to render to 16-bit color textures with
      alpha.

        * Tesla X2090

    * Fixed two bugs that caused sporadic application crashes in some multi-
      threaded OpenGL applications.

    * Fixed a bug that caused creating OpenGL 4.2 contexts
      with glXCreateContextAttribsARB to fail.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL to print

        Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display ":0".

      when used with a non-NVIDIA implementation of the GLX X extension.

    * Implemented color depth 30 (10 bits per component) support for GeForce 8
      series and higher GPUs.

    * Implemented support for constraining cursors to the visible regions of
      connected displays; see the "ConstrainCursor" X Option in the README for
      details.

======== Release 290 Entries ========

2011-11-21 version 290.10

    * Improved the performance of FBO bind operations when using Xinerama by
      ~30% in some cases.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause stereo corruption when driving a stereo
      display and a non-stereo display from the same GPU.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause display devices on a secondary GPU to get
      swapped between X screens when restarting the X server.

    * Fixed a bug that could result in line flickering in full-scene anti-
      aliasing contexts.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the physical dimensions of rotated monitors to be
      reported incorrectly.

    * Add support for the pre-VBO DrawArrays command in the server-side GLX
      driver module.  The NVIDIA client-side GLX implementation never sends
      this command, but the server needs to support it for compatibility with
      other GLX client implementations.

    * Fixed a regression that caused blank/white windows when exhausting video
      memory on GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs while using composited
      desktops.

2011-11-04 version 290.06

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * GeForce GTX 460 SE v2

    * Fixed a bug that would cause applications which export custom allocation
      functions to our driver (such as Adobe Flash in Firefox or Chrome) to crash.

2011-10-21 version 290.03

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the driver from loading on some systems with
      integrated graphics.

    * Fixed issues in VDPAU that prevented allocating and displaying extremely
      large VdpOutputSurfaces.

    * Added support for limiting heap allocations in the OpenGL driver through
      the use of the __GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT environment variable.  See the README
      for further details.

    * Added an "Accel" option to the X driver to allow disabling its use of the
      graphics processing hardware.  This is useful when other components, such
      as CUDA, require exclusive use of the GPU's processing cores.

    * Modified how the OpenGL driver allocates executable memory so it may
      continue to function properly if /tmp is mounted noexec. As some fallback
      allocation methods may be prohibited under SELinux policy, the driver now
      supports detection of this policy as well as manual override of this
      detection via the __GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS environment variable.

    * Fixed a bug that caused various GLSL built-in uniforms to not
      be updated properly when calling glPopAttrib.

    * Improved performance by caching compiled OpenGL shaders to disk. Added a
      "GLShaderDiskCache" option to the X driver to enable/disable this
      feature. Added the __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE and __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH
      environment variables for further configuration. See the README for
      further details.

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:

      GL_NV_copy_image

======== Release 285 Entries ========

    * Implemented support for FreeBSD tunables.

    * Fixed a bug causing flickering in some GPU/display combinations.

    * Fixed a bug causing corruption of images which are 2047 pixels wide.

    * Improved performance of the RENDER extension on Fermi-based GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug causing the X server to crash after a VT-switch while running
      an OpenGL stereo application which is a member of a swap group.

======== Release 280 Entries ========

2011-08-01 version 280.13

    * Fixed a GLX bug that could cause the X server to crash when
      rendering a display list using GLX indirect rendering.

    * Fixed a GLX bug that could cause a hang in applications that
      use X server grabs.

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused 16x8 stipple patterns to
      be rendered incorrectly.

2011-07-26 version 280.11

    * Fixed a GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap bug that caused corruption
      when texturing from sufficiently small pixmaps and, in particular,
      corruption in the GNOME Shell Message Tray.

2011-06-29 version 280.04

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 570M
        * GeForce GTX 580M

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:

      GL_EXT_vertex_attrib_64bit 

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

      GL_ARB_half_float_pixel
      GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil

======== Release 275 Entries ========

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * NVS 5200M

    * Added support for deleting SDI audio ancillary data packets when a video
      frame is dropped on a Quadro SDI Output device.  See the
      NV_CTRL_GVO_AUDIO_BLANKING attribute in NVCtrl.h for details.  This option
      can be set via the "GvoAudioBlanking" attribute in nvidia-settings.

    * Added support for xserver 1.11.99.901 (also known as 1.12 RC1).

2011-12-14 version 275.43

    * Fixed a bug that would cause Firefox to abort on pages with Flash when
      layers acceleration was force-enabled on Linux and Solaris.

    * Fixed a bug that caused a crash when glDrawArrays was used with a non-VBO
      vertex attribute array to draw on a Xinerama screen other than screen 0
      using an indirect GLX context.

2011-11-04 version 275.36

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * GeForce 510

    * Fixed a bug that caused trapezoid and triangle rendering to be very slow
      on older GPUs with xorg-server 1.11.

2011-09-07 version 275.28

    * Added support for xserver ABI 11 (xorg-server 1.11).

    * Fixed a bug that caused the GLSL built-in uniforms gl_FrontMaterial
      and gl_BackMaterial to not be updated properly when calling
      glMaterial from a display list.

    * Fixed an error handling bug that caused the OpenGL driver to
      crash while running certain WebGL applications.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused a glibc assertion when a call to
      VdpDeviceCreateX11 failed in certain ways.

2011-07-15 version 275.21

    * Restored the release splash screen in the NVIDIA X driver (the beta
      splash screen was accidentally re-enabled between 275.09.07 and
      275.19).

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when configuring
      multiple X screens after all monitors were unplugged from one of
      the X screens.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that caused the display configuration
      page to show extra disabled displays after connecting a new monitor.

2011-07-15 version 275.19

    * Fix memory error and abort reported by glibc when running the application
      FieldView from Intelligent Light.

        * Quadro 3000M
        * Quadro 4000M

2011-06-05 version 275.09.04

    * Fixed a bug that caused freezes and crashes when resizing windows in
      KDE 4 with desktop effects enabled using X.Org X server version 1.10
      or later.

    * Modified the X driver to request that hardware inform the audio driver
      whenever a display is disabled. This will allow the audio driver to
      generate the appropriate jack unplug events to applications.

    * Added support for the GL_EXT_x11_sync_object extension.  See the
      extension specification in the OpenGL registry here:

        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/x11_sync_object.txt

      for more details.

    * Improved performance of window resize operations in KDE 4 on systems
      with slow CPUs.

2011-05-19 version 275.09

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

      GL_NV_framebuffer_multisample_coverage
      GL_NV_texture_barrier

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:

      GL_NV_register_combiners2

    * Fixed a bug that caused the pop-out and external DVI displays to go blank
      on Lenovo ThinkPad W701 laptops.

    * Fixed a bug that caused corruption on the menus in OpenOffice.org when the
      screen is rotated.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Java 2D widgets to disappear when Java is
      configured to render using FBOs.

    * Added a new X configuration option "BaseMosaic" which can be used to
      extend a single X screen transparently across all of the available
      display outputs on each GPU. See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the
      README for more information.

======== Release 270 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug causing incorrect reporting of GPU core and ambient
      temperatures via NV-CONTROL.

2011-05-19 version 270.41.19

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause 1
      second hangs when transitioning from blit-based display to overlay-
      based display. This would most commonly happen when disabling a
      compositing manager.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when capturing SDI video.

    * Fixed a corner-case in which the OpenGL driver could leak resources
      in applications utilizing fork().

2011-04-20 version 270.41.06

    * Fixed a bug that caused some GPUs to stop responding when the X Server
      was started. All GPUs are susceptible, but the failure was primarily
      seen on GF104 and GF106 boards.

        * GeForce GTX 550 Ti
        * GeForce GT 420
        * GeForce GT 440
        * GeForce GTX 470M
        * GeForce GTX 485M
        * GeForce GT 550M
        * GeForce GT 555M
        * NVS 4200M
        * Quadro 1000M
        * Quadro 2000M

2011-03-02 version 270.30

    * Added support for xserver ABI 10 (xorg-server 1.10).

    * Dropped support for xserver ABI 9 (which was only used with xorg-server
      1.10 RC2 due to a last-minute xserver change).

2011-02-24 version 270.29

    * Added official support for xorg-server 1.10 [RC2 only, see above].  The
      -ignoreABI option is no longer required with this version of the server.

2011-02-15 version 270.26

    * Added NV-CONTROL event notification for NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_READY
      status changes.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 560 Ti

    * Added a new X configuration option "Interactive", which defaults to
      enabled, but can be disabled to allow long-running GPU compute programs
      to run concurrently with X.

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause VDPAU
      "display preemption" when rendering to tiny or zero-sized windows or
      pixmaps.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU which prevented use of the overlay presentation
      queue following an application exiting without gracefully destroying its
      VDPAU presentation queue.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented the overlay from ever being used if
      a presentation queue was created while the target window was redirected
      using the Composite extension when the presentation queue was created.

2011-01-21 version 270.18

    * Added preliminary support for xserver 1.10.

    * Fixed several bugs relating to hardware-accelerated gradients, which were
      causing visual corruption in some of the default Ubuntu GNOME themes.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_ARB_shader_subroutine
      GL_ARB_map_buffer_range                         

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_half_float
      GL_NV_occlusion_query                             
      GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate                  
      GL_EXT_depth_bounds_test

======== Release 265 Entries ========

    * Modified colormap updates to no longer be synchronized to vblank.  This
      allows applications to send XStoreColor and XStoreColors requests faster
      than the screen's refresh rate.

      This behavior can be controlled by a new NV-CONTROL attribute,
      NV_CONTROL_SYNC_LUT_UPDATES.  By default, LUT updates are not
      synchronized.  This may cause flickering in some applications that use the
      colormap to perform animation, such as xpilot running on a depth 8 X
      screen.  If you experience flickering, try running

          nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/SynchronousPaletteUpdates=1

======== Release 260 Entries ========

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to not update mode timings for G-Sync
      compatibility when NVIDIA 3D Vision or NVIDIA 3D VisionPro is
      enabled along with a G-Sync device.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * Quadro 2000 D
        * Quadro 400

2011-01-21 version 260.19.36

    * Updated the NVIDIA kernel module to ensure that all system memory
      allocated by it for use with GPUs or within user-space components of the
      NVIDIA driver stack is initialized to zero.  A new NVIDIA kernel module
      option, InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations, allows administrators to
      revert to the previous behavior.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X servers version 1.9 and higher to crash when
      color index overlays were enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused pixel value 255 to be treated as transparent in
      color index overlays.

2010-12-13 version 260.19.29

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 460 SE
        * GeForce GTX 570
        * Quadro 5000M
        * NVS 300

    * Fixed a bug that caused some OpenGL applications to become
      unresponsive for up to a minute on some GPUs when changing
      the resolution or refresh rate.

2010-11-11 version 260.19.21

    * Fixed a bug that may cause OpenGL applications which fork to crash.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused it to attempt allocation of huge
      blocks of system memory. This regression was introduced in the
      260.* driver series.

2010-10-13 version 260.19.12

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTS 450
        * GeForce GTX 460M
        * GeForce GT 415M
        * GeForce GT 425M
        * GeForce GT 420M
        * GeForce GT 435M
        * Quadro 2000
        * Quadro 600

2010-09-15 version 260.19.06

    * Fixed an interaction problem with a change in X server behavior that
      caused slow text rendering on X.Org xserver 1.9.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to support interoperability with CUDA and OpenGL when
      Xinerama is active.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented temporal-spatial de-interlacing from
      operating when temporal de-interlacing was not also enabled.

    * Added support for configuring the dithering depth used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.

2010-09-08 version 260.19.04

    * Stopped packaging and installing OpenGL and VDPAU header files
      with the driver.  Those interested in these files can get them from
      their distributions' packages, where available, or upstream from:

        OpenGL header files (gl.h, glext.h glx.h, glxext.h):
            http://www.opengl.org/registry/

        VDPAU header files (vdpau.h and vdpau_x11.h):
            http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU

      Note that while libvdpau.so is still included in 260.xx drivers,
      it will be removed from a future release series in early 2011.
      Distributors are encouraged to package libvdpau.so from
      http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause a "display preemption" when
      toggling MPlayer to full-screen the first time.

    * Added OpenGL 4.1 support for Quadro Fermi, GeForce GTX 4xx, and
      later GPUs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to fully support Xinerama.

    * Fixed a bug in the X driver that prevented operation of Xinerama when
      using multiple NVIDIA GPUs from different major hardware generations
      on X with ABI 4 or greater.

    * Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver's Xinerama support.

      Rendering should have occurred to all physical X screens driven by an
      NVIDIA GPU compatible with the NVIDIA GPU driving physical X screen 0.
      However, if some physical X screen did not satisfy that requirement,
      then not only would that physical X screen not be rendered to (as
      expected), but also all physical X screens with a higher number would
      not be rendered to (which was unexpected).

    * Added GPU "Processor Clock" reporting to the nvidia-settings PowerMizer
      page.

    * Implemented support for SLI Mosaic Mode on Quadro FX 5800 and
      Quadro Fermi and newer Quadro GPUs.

    * Enhanced the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue to allow it to be
      used when SLI is active, and in some cases when the X composite
      extension is enabled. See the README for further details.

    * Added support for configuring the dithering mode used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_EXT_texture_integer
      GL_ARB_stencil_two_side
      GL_EXT_transform_feedback2
      GL_NV_transform_feedback2
      GL_NV_conditional_render

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_point_sprite
      GL_EXT_stencil_two_side
      GL_EXT_point_parameters
      GL_ARB_transpose_matrix
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_multisample

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extension is promoted
      from unofficial GLX protocol to ARB approved GLX protocol:
      GL_EXT_geometry_shader4
      GL_ARB_shader_objects
      GL_ARB_vertex_shader
      GL_ARB_fragment_shader

    * Added support for configuring individual displays as any eye in passive
      stereo mode "4" when using TwinView or SLI Mosaic through extensions to
      the MetaMode syntax.

    * Added ColorSpace and ColorRange features for HDMI. These give
      the ability to output YUV over HDMI and select full/reduced
      color range on RGB over HDMI. ColorSpace and ColorRange
      are X Configuration options and can be changed dynamically
      through nvidia-settings.

======== Release 256 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that prevented XvMC from initializing in most cases.

    * Added support for xorg-server video driver ABI version 8, which will be
      included in the upcoming xorg-server-1.9 series of releases.

    * Fixed a bug that caused extremely slow rendering of OpenGL applications
      on X screens other than screen 0 when using a compositing manager.

    * Fixed a regression introduced after 256.35 that caused stability
      problems on GPUs such as GeForce GT 240.

    * Fixed a slow kernel virtual address space leak observed when
      starting and stopping OpenGL, CUDA, or VDPAU applications.

    * Fixed a bug that left the system susceptible to hangs when running
      two or more VDPAU applications simultaneously.

2010-07-29 version 256.44

    * Added Support for Quadro 4000, Quadro 5000, and Quadro 6000.

    * Fixed VDPAU to not print a debug error message when calling
      VdpVideoMixerQueryFeatureSupport with an unsupported or unknown
      VdpVideoMixerFeature.

    * Removed the requirement that in TwinView passive stereo, MetaModes
      must have identical viewports on each monitor.

    * Removed the requirement that in active stereo, all monitors must
      use identical mode timings.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to better report certain kinds of initialization error.

    * Fixed a regression that caused Xv to return BadAlloc errors on AGP
      systems when using the AGP GART driver contained in the NVIDIA driver.
      This fixes the problem reported in nvnews.net thread 151199.

2010-06-22 version 256.35

    * Fixed a regression in 256.29 where Performance Level clock
      frequencies were reported incorrectly in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a packaging bug that prevented the Linux compatibility libraries
      from being included in the FreeBSD driver packages.

    * Fixed a 3D Vision Stereo bug that caused the stereo glasses to not
      toggle when the flat panel was not running at its native mode timings.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when rendering
      its thermal gauge widget if the range of valid values for the thermal
      sensor was empty.

2010-05-28 version 256.29

    * Fixed a bug which prevented use of high performance PowerMizer
      levels on systems with certain ACPI configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that caused non-primary Fermi GPUs to fail to initialize
      framebuffer memory. This caused a variety of symptoms, up to and
      including system hangs.

2010-05-21 version 256.25

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

       GL_ARB_blend_func_extended
       GL_ARB_draw_buffers_blend
       GL_ARB_sample_shading
       GL_ARB_timer_query
       GL_EXT_draw_buffers2
       GL_EXT_separate_shader_objects
       GL_NV_explicit_multisample
       GL_NV_transform_feedback

    * Improved Thermal Settings reporting in nvidia-settings to
      accurately reflect hardware configurations with multiple thermal
      sensors.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between Compiz and
      'screen-scraping' VNC servers like x11vnc and vino that caused the screen
      to stop updating.
      Fixes Launchpad bug #353126.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to add basic support for Xinerama. VDPAU will now
      operate on a single physical X screen under Xinerama. See the
      README for more details.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's handling of corrupt clips of all formats on GPUs with
      VDPAU feature set C to be at least as good as on GPUs with VDPAU
      feature set B. This significantly improves various clips provided by
      nvnews.net user eamiller.

    * Fixed a bug in Xv attribute handling that caused hue, saturation,
      brightness, and contrast values to be misapplied when using an
      Xv overlay adaptor.

    * Fixed a bug in the XvMC driver that prevented it from working on
      systems with AGP graphics cards.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to clear all VdpVideoSurfaces to black when allocated.
      This provides more consistent results when using a surface as a
      reference when no prior decode operation has written to that surface.
      In turn, this improves the results of decoding some corrupt streams,
      such as "p_only_no_play" from ffmpeg bug 1124.

    * Implemented new APIs to allow sharing VDPAU surfaces with OpenGL and
      CUDA. The OpenGL extension is GL_NV_vdpau_interop. For CUDA, please
      see the documentation in the CUDA toolkit for details.

    * Worked around a bug where the combination of a GPU with VDPAU feature
      set A together with specific motherboard chipsets could cause visible
      corruption when decoding some MPEG-2 streams

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue
      from being used more than a few hundred times per X server invocation.

    * Renamed the driver file libGLcore.so.VERSION to
      libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION, as a small step towards reducing the
      filename collisions between NVIDIA's and Mesa's OpenGL implementations.
      This driver file is used by NVIDIA's libGL.so and libglx.so, and
      should never be used directly by applications.

    * Compressed the nvidia-settings, nvidia-installer, and nvidia-xconfig 
      tarballs with bzip2, rather than gzip.

======== Release 195 Entries ========

    * Fixed a problem with SLI SFR, AFR, and SLIAA modes with GeForce GTX 480
      and GeForce GTX 470 and high-resolution display modes.

2010-04-28 version 195.36.24

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 480
        * GeForce GTX 470
        * Tesla C2050

    * Fixed a problem that caused occasional red flashes in XVideo frames.

    * Added official support for xserver 1.8.  The -ignoreABI option
      is no longer required with this version of the server.

    * Updated the "Supported NVIDIA GPU Products" list to include various
      supported GPUs that were missing previously.

2010-03-15 version 195.36.15

    * Fixed a regression that caused the driver to fail to properly adjust
      the GPU fan speed on some GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented performance level transitions on recent
      GPUs with SDDR3 and GDDR5 memory.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when rendering
      occurred while the X server was not on the active VT.

2010-03-03 version 195.36.08

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * Quadro FX 880M
        * GeForce GTS 350M
        * GeForce GTS 360M

    * Fixed a bug that caused screen corruption after an application
      released a GLX_NV_present_video device.

    * Fixed an X server crash caused by starting nvidia-settings while X was not
      on the active VT.

    * Fixed brightness control hotkeys on some laptops.

    * Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that produced many "Bad argument" warning
      messages when running nvidia-settings --query all.

    * Fixed an installer bug that produced the following message:

        WARNING: Unable to perform the runtime configuration check for library
        'libGL.so.1' ('/usr/lib/libGL.so.195.36.03'); assuming successful
        installation.

    * Fixed a bug that caused G-Sync stereo synchronization to fail sometimes
      when enabling frame lock.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to occasionally crash with
      "double free or corruption" messages when exiting.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set A, enhanced VDPAU's handling of some
      corrupted or incorrectly formatted MPEG-1/2 streams. This solves a
      reported issue with "0testbad.mpg".

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU video mixer that caused chroma aberrations,
      and corruption in the right-hand few columns of pixels, when post-
      processing video surfaces with widths not an exact multiple of 4 pixels.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the GPUFanControlState attribute from
      being set on the nvidia-settings command line.

2010-02-03 version 195.36.03

    * Fixed a regression that made the "TVStandard" X configuration option
      cause system hangs with products from the GeForce 6 and 7 series.

    * Worked around a bug in some AUO laptop flat panels where the native mode
      in the EDID is invalid, leading to a 640x480 desktop repeated six times
      across the screen.

    * Increased the maximum number of slices supported by VDPAU for MPEG-2
      streams, in order to cope with the region 1 DVD "A Christmas Story".

    * Added unofficial preliminary support for xorg-server video driver ABI
      version 7, including xorg-server-1.7.99.2.

    * Fix the soname of libvdpau_nvidia.so.1 and libvdpau_trace.so.1 to
      match their filenames.

2009-12-22 version 195.30

    * Fixed a performance regression with non-anti-aliased text in KDE4.

    * Enabled GPU acceleration for many RENDER compositing operations that were
      previously processed in software, including conjoint and disjoint blending
      modes and component alpha blending.

    * Added experimental GPU acceleration of the RENDER CompositeTrapezoids
      operation. This can be enabled at runtime by running:

        nvidia-settings -a AccelerateTrapezoids=1

      This is only supported on the GeForce GTX series or newer products.

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue that caused
      high CPU usage during "put bits" operations when more than two surfaces
      were queued.

    * Updated `nvidia-settings --query all` to report all available
      attributes queryable through all NV-CONTROL target types.

2009-11-23 version 195.22

    * Enhanced the VDPAU blit-based presentation queue to provide values of
      "first_presentation_time" that have less jitter.

    * Add support for R16F and RG32F GLXFBConfigs when using GeForce 8
      series and higher GPUs.

    * Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Stereo on Linux with Quadro
      GPUs. See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for details.

    * Added support for A2BGR10 32-bit GLX visuals on 30-bit X screens.
      These allow some level of window transparency when using 30-bit
      visuals with GLX and Composite, but they may cause problems with
      older X servers and/or applications.  ARGB GLX visuals can be
      disabled by adding:

        Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "False"

      to the X configuration file.

    * Fixed a problem that caused DisplayPort devices to behave incorrectly when
      DPMS power saving mode was triggered.

    * Updated VDPAU to improve thread concurrency.  See the README for
      details.

    * Altered NVIDIA X driver behavior in the case that no display
      devices are connected to the GPU.  Previously, in this case,
      the NVIDIA X driver would pretend a CRT was connected to the GPU.
      Now, the NVIDIA X driver will not automatically pretend that
      any CRTs are connected.  If the X driver does not detect any
      connected display devices, the X server will fail to start.

      To restore the old behavior, use the ConnectedMonitor X
      configuration option; e.g.,

        Option "ConnectedMonitor" "CRT"

      Alternatively, if display is not desired, Quadro and Tesla GPU
      users can enable "NoScanout" mode, which bypasses any mode timing
      validation or use of display devices; this is configured with:

        Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"

    * Disabled software cursors when the driver is operating in "no scanout"
      (UseDisplayDevice "none") mode.  The software cursor image is not visible
      in remote desktop applications or screenshots anyway, so having software
      cursor enabled was unnecessary.

    * Changed glXSwapBuffers() behavior for a pixmap such that it is now a no-op
      in the direct rendering case in order to match the indirect case and
      comply with the GLX spec. Previously, calling glXSwapBuffers() on pixmaps
      in the direct case would swap the pixmap's buffers if the pixmap was
      double buffered.

    * Modified the installation location and names of internal VDPAU libraries
      to conform to conventions and Debian packaging guidelines. New versions
      of libvdpau expect this layout. Compatibility with old versions of
      libvdpau is maintained with symlinks.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause errors in graphical applications run after a
      previous application using VDPAU and OpenGL. This behavior was observed
      when running Gwenole Beauchesne's hwdecode-demos application.

    * Modified vdpau.h to increment VDPAU_VERSION, to reflect the fact that
      new features have been added in the past. Also, add the new define
      VDPAU_INTERFACE_VERSION.

    * Fixed a periodic temporary hang in the VDPAU blit-based presentation
      queue.

    * Fixed a problem that caused resolution limitations or corruption on
      certain DisplayPort devices such as the Apple 24" Cinema display or some
      DisplayPort to VGA adapters.

    * Disabled the UseEvents option for GeForce 8 series and higher GPUs due to
      a problem that causes occasional short hangs.  It will be re-enabled when
      that bug has been tracked down and fixed.

    * VDPAU now allows multiple streams to be decoded at once, without the
      need to set any environment variables.

======== Older Releases ========

2009-10-21 version 190.42

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings disclaimer window for the GPU
      Clock Frequencies Coolbits page, such that the "Accept" button is
      selectable when the desktop is so tall that the entire disclaimer
      can be viewed without scrolling.

    * Fixed a recent regression that caused the Xinerama option to not be set
      properly in the X configuration file when saving and merging from the
      nvidia-settings X Server Display Configuration page.

    * Fixed a resource leak in VDPAU's blit-based presentation queue.
      This bug limited the number of presentation queue objects that could be
      created and destroyed in a single application instance, and hence could
      limit the number of streams that could be displayed and/or the number
      of iterations of "loop" playback.

    * Fixed a power management regression that prevented some notebooks
      and systems with integrated GeForce 8 and 9 series GPUs from
      suspending.

    * Fixed a regression that caused TV-OUT controls to be unavailable on
      some GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

2009-10-16 version 190.40

    * Added support for OpenGL 3.2.

    * Added support for NVIDIA Quadro SDI Capture, part of the Quadro
      Digital Video Pipeline.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        GeForce G102M 
        GeForce GT 220 
        GeForce G210 
        GeForce G210M 
        GeForce GT 230M 
        GeForce GT 240M 
        GeForce GTS 250M 
        GeForce GTS 260M 

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to allow, on GeForce 8 or greater GPUs,
      more modes to validate on digital display devices whose EDIDs
      report very constrained HorizSync or VertRefresh ranges.

    * Fixed a randomly occurring X server crash caused by the PixmapCache
      option.

    * Increased the allowed amount of overscan compensation from 100 to 200.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set B, VDPAU's handling of some corrupted
      or incorrectly formatted H.264 and MPEG streams has been improved.

    * Fixed a memory allocation problem with pre-GeForce 8
      GPUs that caused GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap clients (e.g., Compiz,
      KDE 4) to display incorrect contents.

2009-09-24 version 190.36

    * Added support for X.Org xserver 1.6.99.901 (also known as 1.7.0 RC1).

    * Add a new OverscanCompensation NV-CONTROL attribute, available on GeForce
      8 and higher.  This option specifies the amount of overscan compensation
      to apply to the current mode.  It is measured in raster pixels, i.e.
      pixels as specified in the current mode's backend timings.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to detect newer Debian distributions that use
      /usr/lib32 instead of /emul/ia32-linux as the 32-bit library path.

    * Added GLX support for OpenGL 3.2 context profiles through the extension
      GLX_ARB_create_context_profile.

2009-09-04 version 190.32

    * Added support for IgnoreEDIDChecksum X configuration option, which can be
      used to force the X driver to accept the EDID of a display device even
      when the checksum is invalid. Please see the README IgnoreEDIDChecksum
      description for a caution and details of use.
    
    * Added support for configuring the GPU's fan speed; see the
      "Coolbits" X configuration option in the README.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
      edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 simple/main profile clips whose
      heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on GPUs with VDPAU feature
      set A.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set C, VDPAU now supports decoding MPEG-4
      Part 2, DivX 4, and DivX 5 video. The VDPAU API has been enhanced to
      expose this feature.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set C, VDPAU now supports a higher quality
      video scaling algorithm. The VDPAU API has been enhanced to expose this
      feature.

2009-08-21 version 190.25

    * Added code to reject screen modes based on available DisplayPort link
      bandwidth.  Fixes display corruption caused by allowing high bandwidth
      modes on display devices that can't handle them, such as certain
      DisplayPort-to-VGA adapters that only support 2 DisplayPort lanes.

    * Fixed an initialization problem on some mobile GPUs.

    * Worked around X.Org X server Bugzilla bug #22804.  This bug
      allows X clients to send invalid XGetImage requests to the
      hardware, leading to screen corruption or hangs.  This was most
      commonly triggered by running JDownloader in KDE 4.

    * Fixed a crash in nvidia-settings displaying GPU information when in Xinerama.

2009-07-23 version 190.18

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions:

        GL_ARB_draw_buffers
        GL_EXT_Cg_shader
        GL_EXT_gpu_program_parameters
        GL_NV_fragment_program
        GL_NV_gpu_program4
        GL_NV_register_combiners
        GL_NV_vertex_program1_1
        GL_NV_vertex_program2

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

        GL_ARB_geometry_shader4
        GL_ARB_shader_objects
        GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object
        GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object
        GL_ARB_vertex_shader
        GL_EXT_bindable_uniform
        GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array
        GL_EXT_geometry_shader4
        GL_EXT_gpu_shader4
        GL_EXT_texture_buffer_object
        GL_NV_geometry_program4
        GL_NV_vertex_program
        GL_NV_parameter_buffer_object
        GL_NV_vertex_program4

      GLX protocol for GL_EXT_vertex_array was also updated to incorporate
      rendering using GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object.
      Use of these extensions with GLX indirect rendering requires
      the AllowUnofficialGLXProtocol X configuration option and the
      __GL_ALLOW_UNOFFICIAL_PROTOCOL environment variable.

    * Fixed glXQueryVersion to report GLX version 1.4.  NVIDIA's GLX
      version has been 1.4 for several releases, and was already reported
      as 1.4 in the GLX client and GLX server version strings.

    * Fixed a problem that caused window border corruption when the screen is
      rotated.

    * Added support for configuring the GPU PowerMizer Mode on
      GeForce 8 or later GPUs with multiple performance levels via
      nvidia-settings and NV-CONTROL.

2009-08-21 version 185.18.36

    * Fixed a bug that caused kernel panics when starting X on some
      mobile GPUs.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between VDPAU and PowerMizer when using
      VDPAU solely as a display mechanism, and not to decode video streams.
      The GPU performance level should now be raised, if required, in this
      scenario.

    * Fixed VDPAU to avoid "display preemption" in some cases where a
      VdpOutputSurface is deleted while it is still active (either queued or
      visible) in a VdpPresentationQueue. In particular, this can occur in
      MPlayer when using the "-fs" option, and could completely prevent
      VDPAU from operating successfully, depending on the exact timing
      conditions.

2009-07-31 version 185.18.31

    *  Fixed a crash on certain mobile GPUs.

2009-07-28 version 185.18.29

    * Fixed a bug that could cause occasional memory corruption problems or
      segmentation faults when running OpenGL applications on Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed a deadlock in the OpenGL library that could be triggered in certain
      rare circumstances on Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed the order of outputs in the GPUScaling nvidia-settings property.

    * Fixed a bug that caused graphics corruption in some OpenGL applications
      when the Unified Back Buffer is enabled the application window is moved.

    * Fixed a bug that caused glXGetVideoSyncSGI, glXWaitVideoSyncSGI, and
      glXGetRefreshRateSGI to operate on the wrong screen when there are
      multiple X screens.

    * Fixed a bug that causes corruption or GPU errors when an application
      paints a redirected window whose background is set to ParentRelative on
      X.Org servers older than 1.5.

      This was typically triggered by running Kopete while using Compiz or
      Beryl.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption when decoding
      H.264 clips with alternating frame/field coded reference pictures, and
      a video surface is concurrently removed from the DPB, and re-used as
      the decode target, in a single decode operation. This affected all GPUs
      supported by VDPAU.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
      edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 advanced profile clips whose
      heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on G98 and MCP7x (IGP)
      GPUs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to better handle corrupt/invalid H.264 bitstreams on
      G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs. This should prevent most cases
      of "display preemption" that are caused by bitstream errors.

    * Fixed an X server crash when using the VDPAU overlay-based presentation
      queue and VT-switching away from the X server.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's detection of the GPU's video decode capabilities.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause ghosting/flashing issues when
      decoding H.264 clips, in certain full DPB scenarios, on G98 and MCP7x.

    * Fixed VDPAU to detect an attempt to destroy the VdpDevice object when
      other device-owned objects still exist. VDPAU now triggers "display
      preemption", and returns an error, when this occurs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's error handling and resource management in presentation
      queue creation and operation. This change correctly propagates all
      errors back to the client application, and avoids some resource leaks.

   Linux specific changes:

    * Added code to forcibly terminate long-running CUDA kernels when
      Ctrl-C is pressed.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between PowerMizer and CUDA applications that
      caused the performance level to be reduced while the CUDA kernel is
      running.

    * Made CUDA compute-exclusive mode persistent across GPU resets.

   FreeBSD specific changes:

    * Fixed an installer problem that prevented Linux ABI compatibility from
      working with newer versions of FreeBSD.

2009-05-27 version 185.18.14

    * Fixed a Xinerama drawable resource management problem that can cause
      GLXBadDrawable errors in certain cases, such as when Wine applications are
      run.

    * Fixed XineramaQueryScreens to return 0 screens instead of 1 screen with
      the geometry of screen 0 when XineramaIsActive returns false.  This
      conforms to the Xinerama manual page and fixes an interaction problem with
      Compiz when there is more than one X screen.

    * Add support for the UseEvents X configuration option on GeForce 8 and
      higher GPUs.

    * Moved kernel module loading earlier in the X driver's initialization,
      to facilitate more graceful fallbacks if the kernel module cannot
      be loaded.  Removed the LoadKernelModule X configuration option.

    * Added support for new horizontal interlaced and checkerboard passive
      stereo modes.

    * Fixed an OpenGL driver crash while running Bibble 5.

    * Fixed a DisplayPort interaction problem with power management
      suspend/resume events.

    * Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance problems
      when a composite manager is running.

    * Fixed a bug with VT-switching or mode-switching while using Compiz;
      the bug could lead to a corrupted desktop (e.g., a white screen)
      or in the worst case an X server crash.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause GPU errors in some cases while driving
      Quadro SDI products.

    * Fixed a several second hang when VT-switching while OpenGL stereo
      applications were running on pre-G80 Quadro GPUs.

    * Added support for multiple swap group members on G80 and later
      Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed the behavior of the NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_DELAY NV-CONTROL
      attribute on Quadro G-Sync II.
    
    * Fixed a problem with Quadro SDI where transitioning from "clone
      mode" to "OpenGL mode" would fail.

    * Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of corruption when decoding H.264
      video containing field-coded reference frames on G84, G86, G92, G94,
      G96, or GT200 GPUs. Such streams are commonly found in DVB broadcasts.

    * Slightly improved the performance of the VDPAU noise reduction
      algorithm.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to validate whether overlay usage is supported by the
      current hardware configuration, and to automatically fall back to the
      blit-based presentation queue if required.

    * Fixed error checking in VdpVideoMixerRender, to reject calls that
      specify more layers than the VdpMixer was created with.

    * Modified VDPAU's VDPAU_DEBUG code to emit a complete backtrace on all
      platforms, not just on 32-bit Linux.

    * Improved interaction between VDPAU and PowerMizer; appropriate
      performance levels should now be chosen for video playback of all
      standard resolutions on all supported GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that sometimes caused "display preemption" when the
      VdpDecoderCreate function failed.

    * Fixed a potential segmentation fault in the VDPAU trace library, triggered
      by a multi-threaded application creating a new VdpDevice in one thread,
      at the same time that another thread detected "display preemption".

  Linux specific changes:

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

  FreeBSD specific changes:

    * Modified VDPAU to dlopen libpthread.so (on all platforms), to avoid
      conflicts between the current libc and a compat libpthread.

2009-04-06 version 185.19

    * Added support for the following new GPUs:

        Quadro FX 3800
        Quadro FX 1800
        Quadro FX 380
        Quadro FX 580
        GeForce GTS 250
        GeForce GT 140
        GeForce GT 130
        GeForce 9600 GSO 512

    * Fixed SDI presentation time queries returning unexpected values.

    * Removed the 'AllowDFPStereo' X config file option, which is now enabled by
      default.

    * Fixed a bug that caused certain programs to hang when multiple threads
      call functions in libdl at the same time.

    * Fixed a driver crash when OpenGL applications use an extremely large
      number of textures.

    * Fixed GPU errors triggered by text rendering to PseudoColor windows with
      the glyph cache enabled.

    * Updated the X driver to allow pixmaps smaller than 32x32 pixels to be
      placed in video memory.

    * Fixed a problem that prevented the driver from retraining a DisplayPort
      link after a device was hotplugged.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to automatically gzip the resulting log file.

    * Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of GPU hangs when decoding H.264
      video on G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs, and supplying a DPB
      missing some reference frames.

    * The VDPAU presentation queue now synchronizes to VBLANK in the blit
      path. The environment variable VDPAU_NVIDIA_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE
      selects which display to sync to when TwinView is enabled;
      see the README for details.

    * On systems using integrated graphics, VDPAU now uses system RAM
      instead of video RAM for many purposes. This should prevent "out
      of resources" problems in most cases, even when the video RAM
      carve-out is configured as low as 128M.

    * Added support for Quad-Buffered Stereo in the main plane
      simultaneously with the Color Index Overlay; i.e., both Stereo
      GLX FBConfigs and Color Index Overlay FBConfigs can be advertised
      and used at the same time, though no single GLX FBConfig contains
      both Stereo and Overlay capabilities.

2009-03-12 version 185.13

    * Numerous internal cleanups and improvements to OpenGL. In particular,
      GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap binding performance problems were resolved.

2009-04-21 version 180.51

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        GeForce 9600 GSO 512
        GeForce 9400 GT
        GeForce GTS 250 
        GeForce GT 130  
        GeForce GT 140  

    * Fixed stability problems with some GeForce 6200/7200/7300 GPUs
      on multi-core/SMP systems.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to compress its log file; running
      `nvidia-bug-report.sh` now produces "nvidia-bug-report.log.gz".

    * Addressed a problem that could lead to intermittent hangs
      and system crashes on some GeForce 9 and later GPUs.

    * Fixed an X server crash when viewing the website www.tim.it.

    * Fixed a DisplayPort interaction problem with power management
      suspend/resume events.

    * Fixed rendering corruption in the OpenGL 16-bit RGB Workstation
      Overlay.

    * Fixed a recent VDPAU regression that caused aborted playback
      and hangs when decoding some H.264 clips on G84, G86, G92, G94,
      G96, and GT200 GPUs.

    * Fixed an interaction problem that could corrupt the EDID of the
      Fujitsu Technology Solutions Celsius H270 notebook's internal
      flat panel.

    * Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance problems 
      when a composite manager is running.

    * Fixed a bug that could interfere with the detection of display
      devices attached to secondary GPUs when first starting X
      after cold boots.

    * Fixed a problem that could result in temporary stalls when
      moving OpenGL application windows on GeForce 8 and
      later GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented VGA fonts from being saved/restored
      correctly on GeForce 8 and later GPUs.

  Linux specific changes:

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Reduced CPU usage of nvidia-smi utility for reporting Quadro Plex
      information.

    * Fixed compatibility problem with LandMark GeoProbe.

  Solaris specific changes:

    * Fixed Solaris installer to not install libnvidia-wfb.so when a wfb
      library is already present.

    * Fixed an initialization ordering bug that could lead to
      kernel panics starting X on some integrated GPUs. 

2009-03-30 version 180.44

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        Quadro FX 3800
        Quadro FX 3700M
        Quadro FX 1800
        Quadro FX 580
        Quadro FX 380
        Quadro NVS 295
        GeForce GT 120
        GeForce G100

    * Fixed a problem that could cause Xid errors and display corruption
      in certain cases when OpenGL is used to render to redirected windows,
      for example when Java 2D is used with the -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true
      option.

    * Updated glGetStringi(GL_EXTENSIONS, i) to no longer return NULL
      in OpenGL 3.0 preview contexts.

    * Fixed OpenGL crashes while running KDE4's Plasma.

    * Fixed OpenGL crashes when using a large number of texture objects.

    * Fixed the timestamp reporting in the GL_NV_present_video extension
      on SDI II with Quadro FX 4800 and 5800.

    * Improved power management support on some systems, such
      as Hewlett-Packard xw4600 workstations.

    * Fixed a problem that caused the screen to flicker momentarily when
      OpenGL applications exit unexpectedly on GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

    * Fixed an X server crash when an X client attempts to draw trapezoids
      and RenderAccel is disabled.

    * Improved recovery from certain types of errors.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Autodesk Maya to freeze when overlays
      are enabled.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between OpenGL and memory tracking
      libraries such as MicroQuill SmartHeap.

    * Added support for RG renderbuffers in OpenGL 3.0.

    * Added support for OpenGL 3.0 floating-point depth buffers.

    * Fixed a problem that caused Valgrind to crash when tracing a
      program that uses OpenGL.

    * Updated VDPAU to support VC-1/WMV acceleration on all GPUs supported
      by VDPAU; see the README for details.

    * Fixed VDPAU corruption on some H.264 clips.

    * Updated VDPAU documentation in the README and in vdpau.h,
      in particular regarding how to use the deinterlacing algorithms
      in the VdpVideoMixer object.  Explicitly documented "half rate"
      deinterlacing, which should allow the advanced algorithms to run
      on more low-end systems.

    * Implemented a "skip chroma deinterlace" option in VDPAU,
      which should allow the advanced deinterlacing algorithms to run
      on more low-end systems. See vdpau.h.

    * Fixed VDPAU VC-1 decoding on 64-bit platforms.

    * Updated the VDPAU wrapper library to print dlerror() messages
      when driver loading problems occur.

    * Improved VDPAU's handling of some corrupt H.264 streams, and some
      corrupt/invalid MPEG streams on some GPUs.

    * Fixed VDPAU to correctly handle WMV "range reduction" on
      some GPUs. A minor backwards-compatible API change was made
      for this; see vdpau.h's documentation for structure field
      VdpPictureInfoVC1.rangered.

    * Fixed a problem that caused surfaces to be marked as visible
      too early when the blit presentation queue is in use.

    * Fixed VDPAU to prevent some cases of "display preemption"
      in the face of missing H.264 reference frames on some GPUs.

    * Fixed corruption decoding H.264 clips with pictures where
      pic_order_cnt_type implies log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 is
      not used, on G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, GT200 GPUs.

    * Update vdpau.h to document exact requirements for VdpDecoderRender
      bitstream data content.

    * Fix VDPAU error handling in some unusual low memory situations.

    * Fix hang in VDPAU in some cases of output mode timing changes.

    * Fixed a bug where setting SLI to "auto" in the X configuration
      file would disable SLI.

2009-02-11 version 180.29

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        GeForce GTX 295
        GeForce GTX 285
        GeForce 9300 GE
        Quadro NVS 420

    * Added support for OpenGL 3.0 for GeForce 8 series and newer GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to display a green screen when
      using the overlay-based presentation queue with interlaced
      modes.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented VDPAU from working correctly
      after X server restarts on some GPUs.

    * Improved VDPAU's handling of mode switches; eliminated a crash

      certain AMD64 CPUs.

    * Added a new Xv adaptor on GeForce4 and GeForceFX which uses the 
      3D engine to do Xv PutImage requests.  This allows XvMC to operate
      when the video overlay is not available (such as in TwinView).
      XvMC still uses the overlay by default, when available.  A new
      XF86Config option "XvmcUsesTextures" has been added to force
      usage of the 3D engine for XvMCPutSurface even when overlays are 
      available.

    * Added a shell script "nvidia-bug-report.sh" that gathers
      system configuration information into a log file; the resulting
      log file (nvidia-bug-report.log) should be included when reporting

      a connector plugged in, fail X screen initialization, rather than
      just print a warning message.

    * Reduced CPU usage when OpenGL applications are syncing to vblank.

2003-7-28 version 1.0-4496

    * Improved OpenGL performance when rendering to multiple

    * Added support for NV30 and NV30 extensions.

    * Fixed bug where there was corruption at the borders of a pbuffer

    * More complete acceleration for the XRENDER extension.  Due to the
      experimental nature, RENDER acceleration is now disabled by default
      (Option "RenderAccel" enables it).

    * The driver no longer uses the XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA),
      but provides its own 2D acceleration architecture to better accommodate
      the needs of simultaneous 3D and 2D rendering.

    * Added color index overlay emulation on Quadro4.

    * Added support for separate X screens on a single GPU (supported
      by all GPUs that support TwinView).

      environments with non-NVIDIA video cards.

    * Significant performance improvements in SPECviewperf on Quadro parts.

    * Added option "NoRenderExtension" to disable the RENDER extension.
      This is useful in 8bpp where the RENDER extension will preallocate
      a large portion of the default colormap and break many legacy 
      applications.

    * Fixed a regression where I420 XvImages had the chroma planes swapped.

    * Fixed some problems with moving overlay windows.

    * Added a dynamic XvMC library "libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so" so that 
      applications can dynamically load the vendor-specific core XvMC
      support.

    * Added XvMC motion-compensation acceleration for NV25 and fixed
      some bugs in the NV17 XvMC support.

      This allows mpeg acceleration on NV17 chips and NV17 chips only.

    * RGB Workstation overlays for Quadro4.  These are double buffered,
      Z-buffered 16 bit visuals.  The transparency key is 0x0000 hex.

    * NV17 and NV25 support.

    * Added an 8:8:8:8 XRGB XvImage format to the video blitter.

    * Config file option for Digital Vibrance Control.
     
    * Added new XF86Config option "FlatPanelProperties" to control dithering 
      and scaling when X is started.

    * Added support for SoftEDID's. When enabled the driver will generate 
      an EDID based on the video BIOS instead of doing a table lookup.

    * Improved Crush support

    * Fixed problem with using SGIX_fbconfig and SGIX_pbuffer with 
      indirect rendering (protocol was incorrect)

    * Fixed problem where the driver would fail on systems with >= 1GB 
      of memory and a kernel configured to use all the memory.

      of immediate mode applications.

    * Improved stability on AMD platforms.

    * Fixed TwinView problem that caused garbage to appear on the screen
      when starting X with a null option on head 0.

    * Added workaround for XAA bug that causes system to hang when Lisa
      Screensaver is run.  The problem is worked around by adding the
      following line in the "Device" section of the XF86Config file:
      'Option "XaaNoSolidFillTrap"'.  This option prevents XAA from
      breaking wide lines (and polygons) into trapezoids and avoids an
      XAA clipping bug.
      
    * Fixed a system hang that occurred on some chipsets when taking the
      X server down (after having run once successfully) and restarting
      it while using the DVI-I connected to a flat panel.

    * Fixed problem where the performer application Perfly would hang
      when run in forked-draw mode.

    * Fixed problem where the X driver would encounter a segmentation fault
      when given an invalid MetaMode.

    * Fixed problem where the console was not restored properly after
      entering X and returning to the console.

    * Fixed problem where X did not redraw completely after a screen
      blank on GeForce 2 Go and Quadro 2 Go.

    * Fixed problem with initializing secondary card. In most cases, the
      secondary card is posted correctly.  In the cases where it isn't,
      there is now a workaround to initialize the card via X.

    * Added workarounds to enable AGP on ALI chipsets and enable 4X AGP
      on VIA chipsets (See README and use with caution!).

2001-08-20 version 1.0-1541

    * Changed behavior of the X server so the NVIDIA splash screen will
      only show up on the first run of X.  This can also be disabled by
      setting an option in XF86Config (see README).

    * Fixed problem where OpenGL applications would sometimes leave
      portions of their rendering behind when the window was closed
      using the kill button on the window banner.

      threads per process.

    * Fixed Xserver crash that occurred when running two Xservers with
      AGPGART.

    * Fixed some problems in GLX that occurred when running
      multi-threaded  applications.

      fault when using a graphical login with xdm/kdm, and doing the following
      sequence: login, mode switch, logout, log in and run a GL app.

    * Fixed some indirect rendering problems.

    * Fixed a problem that caused Xconfigure to fail on NVIDIA drivers.

    * Fixed a crash that occurred when X forwarding over SSH.

      dpy.

    * Fixed problem in which OpenGL would cause a segmentation fault when
      reading X atoms.

    * X now gets the DPI (dots per inch) from the monitor's EDID (rather
      than just defaulting to 75 dpi).

    * All DPMS modes are now supported.  There are still issues on flat
      panels and on the second head of a TwinView system (please see the
      README).

    * Fixed support for AGP on systems with 1 GB or more of memory.

2001-02-16 version 0.9-769

    * Fixed problem where direct rendering applications were allowed to
      continue rendering after xkill was called.

    * Fixed problem where Tribes 2 crashed when compressed textures
      (S3TC textures) were used.

    * Some drawable leaks were fixed in X and GLX.

    * Fixed problem where the application would hang when calling
      glXMakeCurrent while holding the X server grab.

      fixed.  This bug resulted in a significant performance loss.

    * Added support for the X Render extension.

    * TwinView functionality was enhanced so that each head can pan 
      independently.

    * Fixed problem on TNT and TNT2 where Xv(Shm)PutImage returned
      BadAlloc in high resolutions when there was not enough video
      bandwidth to display the YUV video overlay correctly. This works
      now but the resulting display has artifacts.

    * Fixed problem with cursor hangs in X.

    * Fixed problem with X console not restoring on some monitors.

    * Fixed problem with fork() and OpenGL rendering.

      OpenGL operation when on an SMP machine and using the 2.4 kernel.

    * Fixed SYNC_TO_VBLANK hang with 2.4 kernels.

    * DPMS is partially working again. It is possible to set the "off"
      option for DPMS.  DPMS options "suspend" and "standby" are not
      fully supported -- they simply blank the screen.
